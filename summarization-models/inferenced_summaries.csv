"Obviously this deli has been around for awhile... It just has an old feel (in a good way). You walk in and there's no confusion as to what they serve here. A few chips and soda refrigerators on the side, but all of the good stuff is behind the counter. I've been here a few times now and haven't had a disappointing lunch here. The specialties have been posted on the wall behind the counter and a menu is to the left of them. Any of their hoagies with a side of long hots is a decent break for lunch. You've all heard the saying, ""When in Rome..."" Well my own personal saying is ""When you live in Ardmore, buy in Ardmore..."" No really sure if that makes any sense but you catch my drift.  I'm all for the mom and pop establishments, the ones that have lasted years upon years and are being slowly outrun by larger more conglomerate type companies.  J & G Deli, better known as J & G Lunchmeat Villa, is a favorite local spot of mine...Over stuffed, mouth watering hoagies made fresh on the spot; all kinds of homemade pasta to buy and pass off as your own (oops did I say that out loud?); all types of  sandwiches made to order (my personal favorite is ""The Sinatra"" --try it; you'll like it...); anything you are looking for at more expensive Italian type markets, you'll definitely find here but at a cheaper price.  They even make their own homemade red tomato pie...yum..(but if you are having a big party don't forget to order the pie well in advance). The people behind the counter are definitely the friendliest that I have ever encountered. Two thumbs up for J & G.!!! I promise you'll like it. This place was top dog when it came to Italian Specialties before Carlino's came into play. It is family owned and run by John (owner) Gary (his son) and sometimes his wife will be slinging out lottery tickets, or helping out in the back. Nice lady, good family and they treat every customer in there like they were a part of their own. Right there you know customer service is something they believe in.

Their sandwich's are good in size, definitely better than Wawa, the freshness alone stands out there. It's a gonna be a good hoagie when you see and hear the hum of that slicer going. Slice after slice of those meats and cheeses in front of you, knowing it is there to soley satisfy your hunger. Not like other places that keep their meats and cheeses in a stainless steel dish, or a plastic dish. Those leave that taste of blah i guess, don't really know how to describe ""blah "" but I'm sure a facial expression explains ""blah"" better.  

I myself like to add roasted peppers , and long hots on any of their sandwich's.. just brings out the flavor even more. Now if you are a mayo fan, and want it on your sandwich , please don't do it. Adding mayo will  just bastardize the whole experience. 

   ***side note- I personally think the sandwich's could be bit bigger, more meat, pack it in there i say ***

In all you will be pleased with any of the fine selections, and you will be treated like family when you visit. They have changed the name of the place from J & G to Chris's Sandwich Shop & Deli.  They've built out the seating area so you can dine-in comfortably or take out. No waiter service, you order at the counter.   It's bright and CLEAN and super fast and friendly.

FOUR different styles of Italian hoagies plus many other choices and they were all delicious when we visited last weekend.  Same bread - Sarcone's is my bet - and very generous with the meat portions.

Definitely still my favorite, no matter what the name of the place! The best place to get huge hoagies with all of the fixings. This place is the king of Sandwiches and really knows how to hook you up. you get the freshest ingredients, sharpest provolone, and the meats are piled high. My favorite is the ""Dominik Diabla"" - cooked hot with melted swiss, chicken breast, and whatever fixing you want. 
The hoagies are HUGE so you should be able to have your hunger satisfied with a medium or large hoagie. but super-sized options are available. it is also a pretty good marketplace. J & G has recently been sold, so Faithful Dining Companion and I stopped by to see what did and didn't change.

First, they've cleared out most of the market shelving.  No longer will patrons be able to pick up a box of pasta, some gravy, soup and bread.  Instead, they've created a dining space by the deli counter with a wall of coolers filled with sodas and such.  The 'back' dining area has been curtained off, and there's no shop entrance any longer off County Line Road.

The checkout counter is new, lower, broader and the whole presentation is much cleaner, brighter and more like a restaurant than a deli.  

We both ordered the 'medium' (8"") Italian Hoagie, which was made promptly. Bread is the same, hoagie is now featuring hard shaved parmesan cheese, which adds a pleasant 'bite' reminiscent of Tony Luke's at 4 & Oregon Aves in South Philly.  It's a good taste, very distinctly old school Italian. It is a change from previous though and definitely separates them from the pack of Wawa and Primo's in the area.

Nice to see the place being taken care of with love, it was getting a bit worn down, and the changes to the classic Italian are a nice thumbs up.  You still have our love, J & G! So this was just fine, but didn't quite live up to the five-star average. I had an Italian hoagie. Meat and cheese were high quality and the bread was fresh, if a little soft for my taste. $8.00 for a footlong seemed more than reasonable. 

The space is modest but well-kept and the folks running it could not have been nicer or more welcoming. 

That being said, it just wasn't a five-star sandwich for me-- I prefer Carlino's and Soprano's. Definitely worth a stop, though. This deli is nothing special. Solid sandwiches but nowhere near paganos, p&s or centrellas which are in the area. 

I love their chicken salad. Just added seeded rolls to their repetoire. Based on the reviews from the customers, I ordered 2 hoagies trays for a party.  Everyone wanted to know where the hoagie trays came from....so Chris' Sandwich shop be prepared to increase your customer base because I gave out your information.   The hoagies were awesome, we even had some people fixing to-go plates and hiding their hoagies.  In other words, they became the hoagie-burglar, after taking a bite!  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.  Great gamble! This Deli is Fantastic! They have been in the same location in Ardmore Forever. They make Delicious Hoagies the size of your Arm. Everything they use is quality! I like both their Tuna and Italian. If you ask for Hot Peppers they use Jalepenos instead of cherry peppers, which give it a little different flair.","General:  Here's what I came up with:

"Came here for lunch this past week. We got some coupons in the mail for a buy a lunch sandwich and two drinks and get a free lunch sandwich. We were greeted at the door and the person at the counter offered suggestions about sandwiches. We ended up getting the chicken pesto bagel sandwich and the pastrami sandwich, as well as two drinks per the coupon. 

The drink counter needs some re-vamping. I think it was around the time they were closing, and the iced tea smelled like a dirty bathroom. We poured out our tea and got coffee instead. Their iced coffee was better, but a little watered down. I like how you can put in squirts of different flavorings to your coffees, but these dispensers looked like they had been there for awhile.

I think what makes this place a 2 star is the condition of the actual restaurant. It reminds me of a really really old McDonald's in design. The bathrooms were really smelly, and there were around 10 flies buzzing around inside the eating area because they had their door propped open. It made me wonder about all the food behind the counter and how many flies had landed on it.

The sandwiches themselves were quite tasty. Loved the flavors of both sandwiches, although the pastrami probably won out. The pickle on my tray was a little dried out but I love pickles so I ate it anyway. They only give you a small condiment container size portion of either macaroni salad, potato salad, or something else that escapes my memory.

I wanted to love this place, and as good as the sandwiches were, the atmosphere really makes you not want to eat there. There needs to be a little more attention to detail. Worst bagels I've ever had, the place is dirty on the inside, terrible service and the manager is BEYOND rude. Even if the bagels were great I would still never come back because of the manager's attitude. Bagels are pretty much my favorite thing ever. Unfortunately, the boyfriend does not feel the same way, so we must have driven past this place a few dozen times before I vetoed sushi the other day and insisted we come here for lunch instead.

They must have renovated since the two star review from 2010, as everything looked pretty damn new and clean to me. There was a short line, which gave us almost enough time to look over the menu and ogle the huge selection of bagels. I really just wanted my perfect bagel I've loved since I was a kid (sesame bagel with butter, cheese, lettuce and tomato), and there was no drama at all ordering it even though it wasn't on the menu. The boyfriend had a focaccia that looked delicious, and he said as much. The place was pretty packed, but we were able to snag a table right away as someone waiting for a to-go order vacated, and the food was brought to us in no time at all. Everything was spot on, right down to the potato salad. 

Oh, and as we were leaving, the guy who took our order was eating his lunch at the next table, which is always a good sign, and he still stopped to thank us for coming.

Yummy food, happy employees, and a convenient location. Yes please. Called in an order to take brunch for my mom. Unfortunately the manager was on vacation, which seemed to leave chaos in the kitchen, and when I got to my mom's place, the sandwiches were literally empty inside! Whitefish salad ordered for both, but none on either one. See photos.

The manager made good on it the next week. She personally made me two huge sandwiches (we could've shared one) and didn't charge for either one. They also had credited my card for the empty sandwiches received a week earlier. So that manager fixed a negative situation.

On the plus side, the whitefish salad is kick ass, and their bagels are light and delicious. I also like that they put toppings on both sides of the bagel, not just on the top. This is definitely my go to place for picking up a bagel when I go to see my mom! The staff is friendly! Food is great, coffee is consistent. Overall my experience over the past few visits have been great. James and crew thanks for all you do in the community. 
Variety of bagels are amazing! See you tomorrow crew! I decided to give this location a try and the service was sub par from the moment I walked through the door. I ordered the avocado, lettuce, and tomato bagel and the sandwich was mostly bread. I was only able to enjoy a third of it because of the lack of ingredients. I would not recommend this location. The outside  of the store is poorly kept.
It's difficult to trust quality and cleanliness inside when the exterior 
lacks care.
K.Tague One of the best authentic bagel houses. It is a little on the pricey side but if you want really really delicious bagels, this is the place to go to. 

We had breakfast where we tried a spinach/egg/cheese on an everything bagel as well as the Lox on an onion bagel. Both were really tasty and freshly prepared. Lox comes with a heavy dose of cream cheese so be prepared for that. The capers in the Lox sandwich give it a really nice kick. The chai tea latte was OK, probably won't get it again. Hashbrowns are a little greasy.

They also sell bagels by the Baker's dozen, half dozen, or individually. They provide freezer bags if you want to save for later.

Parking can be cramped especially on weekend mornings but they offer additional parking in rear. This place is the worst. We've gone there a number of times based on convenience and the fact that they have decent food, but they have gotten our orders wrong more than half of the time. Will not be going back, no matter how convenient it is. Have been coming here for a while but they have a new cashier who is rude and obnoxious. She asked if she could take the coupon I placed on the counter (I was busy pulling out my credit card and what would have been her tip), I said yes and she responded, ""Yeah well you put it there so I didn't know what you wanted me to do with it."" I looked at her funny and said, ""Yeah well I'm not keeping the coupon so..."" and she proceeded to say things like, ""I just wanted to know what you wanted to do because you put it there and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that."" Let me make it easy for you--I won't come back--or I'll ask to see any of the other way nicer, less petty staff! Usually they are great but this new blonde lady is obnoxious. Who argues with a customer over a coupon? I tried not to mind her before (was trying to enjoy my breakfast recently but she kept singing Christmas carols loudly and way off key) but if she's going to be rude, forget it. I'll take my business elsewhere.","General:  The summary should be no longer than 3 sentences.

"A restaurant is only as good as it wants to be and this one is mediocre at best. If you can hide the food in gobs of cheese and sauce, it's decent. That said, the quesadillas were our pick. The margaritas, on the other hand, were quite bad. C'mon guys, you can do better! If this place didn't have an outdoor patio on Davis Islands, I would wonder how it manages to endure year in, year out. It's the worst ""Mexican"" restaurant I've ever eaten in. If you want anything like decent Mex, you'd be well-advised to hop a plane and fly over to Texas, Arizona or southern Cal. We have nothing like that around here. Apologies to the many Taco Bus fans. I'm not on board with that, either.

We went here on a Sunday night, late, around 9, because we had a 2-4-1 coupon. Well, they didn't take it because they said it only applied to their Brandon and South Dale Mabry locations. Fine.

Then it took about 30 minutes to bring out a combo platter. If it hadn't been drowned in cheese and tomato ""sauce,"" it would have been fairly awful. The chili relleno tasted like a chemical. The salsa consists of pureed tomato, lemon juice and tons and tons of salt, I think. It's borderline ketchup, We ordered a Margarita. To be fair, it was huge and it did have a ton of cheap tequila in it. They even forgot to add it to the final bill, so kudos for that, at least.
Why does this place keep them coming back? Dreadful. Why 1 star?  A frozen dinner is a better decision.

   ---   ---   ---

Apologies to all of the Estela supporters out there:  Estela's is absolutely terrible Mexican food.  I realize that I am tougher to please as a native Houstonian, which is essentially makes me a Mexican...but wow.  I wonder how places like this and Tijuana Flats stay open.

I went once and had awful food.  My friend really enjoyed the place and wanted to go back again, so I gave it a second chance.

The second chance was worse.  It was so bad that I haven't been back in nearly five years. We came on a Saturday night and there was not a single other table in the restaurant.  A few groups sat on the outdoor patio, but we were it for inside.  Unfortunately the air conditioning was freezing and I was dressed for the weather outside - maybe I would have enjoyed it more if we had opted for the patio.  The margaritas were huge and pretty tasty, but super light on the tequila.  When you make them that huge, you really need to use more than one shot of liquor, okay?   Thanks.  
The food itself was okay.  Maybe Californian Mexican restaurants have spoiled me, but. . . I thought it was alright.  Definitely edible, but I won't be dreaming about it, even though my friends raved.  To each their own.
The service was fast and friendly, and because they were out of Jack Daniels, my friend was awarded a complimentary shot of tequila.  Nice. Shitty food.  None of it struck me as fresh.  Most of it tasted like it came out of a can right off the back of a Sysco truck.  It has about as much flavor as Country Kitchen Buffy.  Seriously awful. Why 2 stars? Continued homage to the Brett. :)

We went to see the flooding and the Portable and I were hungry... too late to cook. Well, Estela's has perfected mediocre. To be fair, kids don't understand that you don't order a burger at a Mexi restaurant. But at least make an effort... The burger that arrived was beyond overcooked and looked like it was found behind the bar somewhere. How does cheese become crispy on the bun? Sorry, no excuse. Do it decent or drop it from the menu. Ugh.

My Mexi meal was ok. coated in some sort of white cheese sauce that kinda killed the moment. Salad side was fresh but blah, orange tomato slice didn't help. Rice was so-so and seemed old, clumpy and flat tasting. Plus side, Service was decent, waitress was prompt and polite until the check, she was tough to find but not a deal breaker. 

The gut impression I get in this place is be careful what you touch, it's sort of sticky. With upstarts like the TacoBus downtown, these guys better step up their game. This is old school Yankified Mexi food that is not that great. 

Probably the last time I say check please at this one. $19.69. That's how much I paid for lunch at Estela's on a Sunday afternoon. Absurd. I was expecting the steak fajitas to be absolutely phenomenal--unfortunately the fajitas were mediocre at best. Certainly not worth an Andrew Jackson.

Salsa. If a restaurant has great salsa, it's probably going to get at least three stars from me. Estela's salsa packed zero heat and had a watery flavor. Definitely not a fan. (Note: if I go again, I'll ask for the hot salsa--too bad our server didn't mention it...)

I liked the way the restaurant is decorated. It's definitely a Mexico-meets-Tampa-Bay theme. Pretty cool. The quilts hanging for the ceiling were awesome. I ate here with a couple people, including someone who is an art major, and they were impressed with the decorations. Win.

Expensive, unremarkable food; unimpressive. Estela's quickly became one of my favorites when I moved to South Tampa a few years ago. This is by far my favorite location because of the outdoor space, and the laid back vibe that Davis Islands is known for. 

The happy hour specials here are fantastic, 2-4-1 house margaritas/sangrias served in the big glasses. They have a little too much ice, but hey, 2-4-1- isn't horrible regardless...

Food is good too. Nothing too fantastic, but always tasty. They have a large menu full of options, make sure you check everything before ordering. Also noted that someone wasn't happy about their prices; in my opinion, its better to order off their a-la-carte menu (on the bottom of the back page). It's a better deal and you can get more of a spread. Had heard some good things about this place.  Didn't get a chance to even really try the food because the service was so bad.  

The waiter was extremely rude.  We thought he was just busy but by the time we left it almost seemed personal!  We asked for waters with our margaritas several times and he never brought them out.  We had to ask the busboy to bring waters.  We wanted to have dinner but we couldnt get the waiter to come back to the table so we ordered some con queso from the busboy.  Our waiter brought out the con queso, but with no chips.  By this point we just got the bill and left, after tipping the busboy.  

Terrible place.  Will not go back.  So many other great Mexican places to go.  Go to Miguels or even Taco Bus if your looking for Mexican food. Typical Mexican food. There are a lot of options to choose from.  The margaritas are great.  The name recently changed to Margarita's.  It is nice to sit outside, one can bring their pup and they provide water.  It is a nice people watching place.","General:

"Salerno's III on Lower Ferry Road, Ewing, NJ, recently changed hands, but has not lost its verve.  

I stopped in for lunch earlier this week thinking I would have two slices of pie and be on my way. Those plans quickly evaporated when I was handed their lunch menu by the friendly server wearing a wonderful Italian accent.  Available were many downsized dinner dishes at very attractive sub-$10. Okay. I gave it a try. 

I ordered cavatelli aglio olio.  It came with a nice side salad, and a basket of garlic knots/rollups. It was a substantial meal that would easily last through dinner.  The salad was romaine based, with sliced tomato, cucumber and red onion, with a standard balsamic dressing. The bread was right out of the oven and very tasty, especially as sops for the garlic/oil bath of the pasta bowl.  The cavatelli was cooked well, with amply browned garlic throughout.  There may have been a bit too much broth on the bottom of the bowl, but it was easy to adjust to avoid drippage.  

This was a very pleasing and substantial lunch.  It was certainly bigger than I have encountered in other Italian houses in the area, and the taste was very good.  Certainly, dinner would have been enough for two.  

I came for pizza, but ended up with something much better - a complete meal that was as pleasurable as it was surprising. This place is great for delivery because they always come on time and get your order right. The pizza is also really good and they have Nutella pizza. I highly recommend. The food is good and the service is great! Bye Bye Salerno's.  Your food is decent but after ordering by phone and arriving to pick up my pizza 35 min later you said you didn't make it - no reason given!  Not the first time this has happened but it WILL be the last because I won't be back! Feeling particularly lazy I decided to try the delivery and ordered dinner for my son and I online. The delivery arrived earlier than expected which I was glad because the estimated over an hour.
When it arrived I was sort of shocked and disappointed at the size of the pizza.   looking at the menu I realize it doesn't state how big the pizzas is or how many people should serve.
Aside from the high price for a small pizza I was less than satisfied with the overcooked crust Bottom line: standard neighborhood pizza. 

Gluten line: safe pie, happy wife!

Long line: having gone with a friend, I can critique both pizzas (rather than when i just share a gluten free pie with wifey). The gluten free pie was good. Standard thin-ish crust, grilled chicken, spinach and mushrooms. Also had a meat lover type slice our friend got which was generous on toppings and flavor. The spot as I mentioned is very family oriented, neighborhood pizza joint, so nothing fancy but food is great and affordable! We've ordered (delivery thru Yelp 24) many times now. Over the years, we've tried quite a few of the local pizza joints here in Trenton/Ewing, both big chains and individual shops. 

So far, Salerno's has the best pie hands down. My personal fav is the Brooklyn; LOVE the crust, fresh mozzarella, basil, and the tomatoes are the best. The summer is loved by my daughter, and it is pretty good. The boys like the basic cheese plus sausage/pepperoni. Tomato pie was good, too.

We can also strongly recommend the chopped antipasto salad. It's a tad expensive, but that's because it's a TON of delish meats, cheeses, etc. 

So far we pretty much like everything. Best local pizza and a great place to get delivery. They are always on time and the food is fresh. Best pizza I've had in NJ so far. It's taken a while but i've finally found the best place for tomato pie / pizza in the ewing area.  While most places are expensive with average pizza at best. Salernos delivers a quality pizza for a quality price. Their 2 tomato pie deal for 18.99 on Mondays and Saturdays is such a bargain. On top of all this, if you're a student you automatically get 20 percent off. Salernos is a place built by the people for the people. And the people are here to tell you, Salernos should be your next stop when you're looking a quality slice in Ewing. 

#Iwasntpaidtowritethis As a policy, I never like to leave negative reviews because of the incompetence of others who aren't the owner nor the chefs.  with that said, a restaurant will not be able to learn from their mistakes without these reviews. So today will be the first.  Working at a large company near by, we usually do large take out orders from this restaurant.  Food has always been good, and never had any issues.  

Today we placed a decent large order for our department.  However, I guess that didn't go well with the girl taking our order.  As she puts her phone down, we can hear her talking negatively about us to her co workers.  First of all if you're going to speak negatively of us on the phone, I do suggest you put yourself on mute.  This hostess then just informs us to place our orders on grub hub next time.

There is no policy in place stating than any customer must place large orders online.  If there was, I do suggest you put that on your menu / website.

"DO NOT GO TO THIS CHIPOTLE. Nobody at this place cares about their jobs or the customers. They moved slower than any people I've ever seen in my life. The burritos and the bowls were so small compared to the Chipotle standards we are used to. When we asked the cashier for a bag of chips she disappeared into the back for 3 minutes before she came back with them. The overall experience here was miserable and we will not be returning. There's another one 5 minutes down the freeway--go to that one instead. I love Chipotle. My boyfriend takes me all the time, but today was my first visit to this location. Don't ask me why we ate here. Idfk, because we should have turned around and walked out. This was our experience:

1. The pinto beans were dry. I get it. It happens, but these were beyond a little air exposed. We mentioned it and the worker removed them from the line. There weren't anymore cooked, so we settled for the less dry black beans. But guess what...the nasty beans they removed, yeah, they stirred them and served them from the back to the next guest that requested pinto beans.

2. I thought the rice wasn't very glisten-y, but I ignored myself and got it anyway. Once I started eating, I realized both the white and brown rice were dry and hard, possibly undercooked. I left the majority of mine in my burrito bowl. 

3. The carne asada was dry. It wasn't running out, but they dumped some fresh carne asada on top, probably to cover the dry meat.

4. Let's talk stingy portions. I was getting a VEGGIE bowl. Don't freakin' jip me on the guacamole! Or rice! Or even lettuce for that matter! This ain't Deadpool. Don't serve me with your baby hand. Sheesh!

5. Now, price. I may have never paid attention to the price of a bottle of water at any Chipotle before, but I paid $2.45 for a bottle of Deer Park water. Are you kidding me?! We paid over $27 for the 2 of us and didn't even get chips!

6. And finally, it was kinda dirty. Not the filthiest, but there were food crumbs on empty tables, food on the floor, a not-so-pleasant toilet. The place wasn't busy at all. No reason to be so messy.

This store just looks like it's being run by a bunch of kids that don't know wth they're doing, and there's no reason for it because there are reviews out there from a year ago that should have prompted management to take care of this. Smdh Chipotle, y'all need to get it together at this location. You're gonna make people sick.  

P.S. I'm pretty sure they saw my boyfriend taking pictures because they came out soon after and started cleaning everything on the line and in the dining room. At least they took the hint, but we won't be going back there. This only gets one star, even though the staff was pleasant. The food was good, but I was violently ill not even two hours after eating. I don't know what happened, but you guys really need to check it out. Not I have to miss work today bc I was up all night sick af. Each time you go to a chain you expect consistency because consistency means you get the quality service you are looking for. This Chipotle was no different. What I liked about the place was the layout it was unique and I appreciate that completely. Service was great and so was the food. I was pleased with the service. First time at this relatively new location and was rather disappointed. We ordered online and picked up at the drive thru. Our order was completely wrong and because we trusted them to bag a simple order, we didn't realize it until we got home. 

When I called the store we were offered a ""free entree"" next time for stale chips, wrong food, etc. That didn't sit well with me. From there I contacted corporate and attached photos so they could compare what I ordered online vs what was received. 

The way corporate handled it took my one star review up to three stars. I emailed them, and I kid you not, within about three minutes I had a reply and was offered an apology and full refund. 

This place has a very young crew who will be out jobs if they do this regularly to people. I was very disappointed. The chips were stale and salty. The service was poor. They were very busy and did not serve the food properly, and I felt very rushed. But the guacamole was good which is why I gave it a 1 star. Mobile orders not ready on time. Tried it for the first time and my order was not ready at the 12:45 pickup time. I stood there til almost 1:00 asking what the delay was as I had only ordered one burrito and chips with queso. Employees are nice but it would have been faster going through the line as everyone who was in line were already seated enjoying their meal. Pickup ordering is a fail! I love Chipotle, however, I was very turned off by the open trash cans all throughout the restaurant and most were overflowing even on the patio. There was food on the floor and it wasn't crowded at the time. I'm not sure I would go back to that location.
The staff was nice.
Why don't they have recycling cans? My burrito was disgusting and not mixed together well only had meat on one side and all the beans on the other side. The rice tastes like someone mad minute rice and squirted lime all over it. Not to mention the kids meal I purchased for my son looked and tasted like something you would have seen people eating during a depression or something when rations were distributed. Overall an awful experience and would have givin it 0 stars if I could have. If you're looking for a good build your own burrito place go to MOES or Blue Coast Burrito. I love Chipotle! I've eaten at more than a dozen locations in maybe 6 or 8 states. I know all the ingredients and how things should taste. I was so excited when the Smyrna location opened a couple weeks ago that I've been here 4 times already! The food is delicious, like normal! Large portions here as well.","General:  The summary should be no longer than one sentence.

"I love the Red Garter.  It was a long, hard road to get to love this place.  It was not easy.  But, with the help of Guinness beer, Amy the server, the San Francisco burger and friends that are always willing to come with me, the Red Garter and I found love.

The first time we went, I got a veggie burger, and it was horrible.  To be fair, a lot of times veggie burgers are revolting in restaurants because they don't get ordered or thrown out, so you get some pathetic, freezer burnt hockey puck.  My husbands burger was delightful, so we went back, I think the next night, and I got a real burger.  Oh my gosh.

This place has the best burger in Tucson.  They are just amazing, and juicy, and they have a zillion of them, and all of them are amazing.  My personal favorite is the San Francisco, which is on sourdough bread with lettuce, onions, tomatoes and Thousand Island dressing.  It's amazing.  (Yes.  I know a used the word ""amazing"" a lot for this burger, but that's what it is...so there).

So, onto the service, which really is what made this road to loving this place to damn horrible.  I really wanted to like this place.  The food is awesome, the atmosphere is fun and very neighborhood-bar-y.  But the service, until we had Amy as a server, was hideous.  Servers were super rude, our drinks never got refilled, one of them took a LOT of sass with my brother who had just gotten home from being deployed (that one had me really upset).

Then we met Amy, the shining beam of freaking sunlight.  I always want to sit in her section (I hope the owner reads this.  She is the reason I decided not to write off your establishment).  Now, it is the perfect bar.  It has great drinks for pretty cheap, stellar service, and the best burger this side of the Rio Grande.  Or the other side.  

Go to here.  Sit in Amy's section.  Get a Guinness and a San Francisco burger.  Know bar peace. Wonderful to find this place in our neighborhood.  Relocated permanently to Tucson in September 2021 - walked by here many times before visiting, from the outside I could take it or leave it - appears a bit 'dated' - DO NOT let that deter you from going inside....

Tried it in November 2021 - will be a repeat customer, likely every week.  The menu is extensive which caused me some trepidation, when a place focuses on too many items, my experience is the food suffers (Think Cheesecake Factory)  I had the fries (perfectly cooked), then the cheeseburger with onion rings (Again perfectly prepared) - 5 stars.  Service from Kellie - 5 stars, bartenders super efficient, reasonably priced food / drinks.  Four pool tables in the non smoking section, separated by four pool tables in the smoking section (glass divider).   Place smells / looks really clean, bathrooms fully stocked and clean.  My only criticism (jokingly) is the door to the outside squeaks by the pool tables - but I picked up a can of WD40 yesterday and will solve that issue next visit.  

Look forward to my next visit, working my way through the French Dip and then the Rueben!  Thanks Red Garter for creating a cool place in the Pala Verde neighborhood!   See you soon. I really dig this little bar. I would describe it as divey but with really good upkeep. There is a bar that runs along (most of) the length of the place and a dining area with cute old-school burgundy leather chairs. It is all carpeted so don't throw up. There are pool tables in the back and TVs (various sizes) everywhere so I can imagine this is a great place to watch games. College football was playing when I went. 

The food was surprisingly good. My burger was delicious and LOADED with green chilies, cheese, bacon, and sauteed onions. My fiancees burger and brother's sandwich were winners as well. The fries could have been better but it's all good. The menu boasts many burgers and sandwiches so variety is something Red Garter has going for them for sure. 

I really look forward to returning! Comfy leather booths and patio seating. Great wings and burgers. Play a song on the jukebox, and get in a cozy local mood. One of my favorite group meet-ups or pre-game spots.
              5 STAR PATTY MELT When i walked into this place i knew i wanted to play pool. There was like 9 or 10 tables and at 75 cents a play I was in.

The waitresses came over pretty often so I would say service is good, and because they were cute this was a welcome sight.

The place had a good vibe to it, not completely divey but not too college either. Those are the extreams i guess, oh no and the uppity bars, thats another category that I hate.

Anyways good food, service, and times. This review is basically based off of the service because I did not realize that food was served here and are before I came to meet up with my friends.
The waitstaff is nice though can be at little unorganized. It makes sense since they are being pulled in a million directions. If you want to get a pool table I wish you luck and if you do have one, sit on it because a lot of people will come behind you to take it.
The bartenders know how to make a good drink which is the most important thing in this type of establishment. I enjoyed it enough to where I need to come back and try the food. Eh...just pretty much your average, dive-y bar without much character. For standard, fried bar food, it was good. The sandwich I had was toasty and fresh and one of my friends had a salad that looked very good too. Our large party was accommodated quickly, though kind, our server was visibly overwhelmed and frazzled. With the selection of places in Tucson, I'd rather go elsewhere. -The best part though, The Red Garter is inexpensive. Best bar food and place to hang out. 

You can hang out on the patio or stay inside. You can shoot pool or have a meal. You can have a few drinks as well. This place has beer from local breweries. Yum. Try a Tucson Blonde, if you haven't or have a Chicken Finger Basket or curly fries.

And the prices. Wow! I paid $13 for a meal and two beers.

Yum. Yum. We've been here for 10 minutes and the waitress has walked past twice with no acknowledgment.....the place is dead, btw.  Oh wait, we just asked for service and she had to go wipe down a table next to us first...... yay, we finally ordered beer 13 minutes later Stopped by here for a burger and a beer. Liked the Hefeweizen and the burger was nicely done as well. Noticed they have some biker (as in Harley) nights and thought that sounded cool.","General:  The summary should be concise and informative.

Summary: The Red Garter is a dive bar with a friendly atmosphere, offering a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and local beers at affordable prices. The service can be slow and unorganized, but the food and drinks are generally well-received by reviewers.

"In Calcutta, there is a tasty street food called a Kati Roll found on every corner. 

Typically, a paratha (less chew and thinner than Naan bread) is cooked before your eyes, dipped in an egg wash, and then filled with a mix of spicy onions and a meat (or paneer) of your choice. More sauces are added, then you pay the equivalent of like 2 bucks, and you devour it whole. I's not healthy, but it's similar to eating a taco at 2 in the morning. Kati Rolls taste even better if you've been drinking :)

ANYWAY, Spice Box has a version of the Kati Roll, called a ""Spice Wrap"". I've had the ""Channa Spice Wrap"" (channa = chick peas) and the ""Shrimp Spice Wrap"". Both are fantastic. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, still tender, and the channa were deliciously savory.

More Indian restaurants in Indianapolis should embrace India's diverse food culture. Spice Nation finally does South Indian vegetarian (with lot's of room for improvement), and now Spice Box is doing Indian street food.

Bring it on! I was pretty excited to try an Indian food truck since Indian is one of my favorite foods.  I'm out here on business from the SF Bay Area so I'm comparing with some pretty high standards.

This definitely ended up being pretty meh.  I had the Bollywood which comes with a chicken tikka wrap (literally just chicken tikka in a paratha, not naan as the menu says).  I also had aloo gobi and rice on the side.  The rice was definitely overcooked and but the aloo gobi was pretty good.  The mint chutney also tasted pretty different.

Overall, for a food truck in the middle of the land of bland, I'll give it 3 stars. Spicy shrimp by golly! It's delish!!!

I love Spice box- especially the Bollywood. When you order it the workers all yell Bollywood and it is their prize...so I get what all of the hollering is for...it's like the Juliet Roberts of street walkers- it might be served out of a truck on the side of the street but it is damn good. 

They are kind and make great recommendations. They always have great service and delicious fare- have yet to have anything I don't like and I am by no means an Indian Food lover, but they do it right! Food Tried:
- Spice Wrap (chicken) (2 for $6)
- Spice Box (chicken tikka) ($7)

I'm not even gonna say it again. You all know I love Indian food. It's why I was so pleased when Taco Lassi opened. While they specialize in a hybrid Mexindian style, the concept that I can get so many delicious kinds of Indian food in my favorite mode of consumption is amazing. Now, sweet day, I can also get classic Indian food from a truck as well. Happy happy joy joy for Spicebox Indy! Also, they are smart to know to woo me with a few things on the house, so that when I pay for my meal, I'm already so pleased, I am nearly sure to enjoy my meal.

From Spicebox, I had their wrap, which I think is a tortilla wrapped around marinated chicken with a spicy mint chutney sauce drizzled all over. Perfect to grab and walk with. Awesome flavor. Great crunch. Also, wonderful to give one energy at the gym (I ate a wrap and then popped to the gym, no fatigue that day!). If you're not the conventional Indian fan, or aren't quite sure if you like Indian, this is a good place to start (though perhaps with a less spicy sauce... mmm mint chutney).

I also had their classic dish: the spice box. They have a few options for this one, usually a meat one and a veggie one, but I opted for chicken tikka, which is one of my favorite dishes. So, so good. Chicken tikka has a tomato onion sauce, and than, over rice, with chunks of tender chicken, and doused with a healthy dose of mint chutney sauce (YUM). I sat in the sun on the stairs of the circle, lost in a world of electronic music and with a mouth of warm, smooth flavors. I think I tweeted it, but I seriously ate the whole thing in about seven minutes. And wasn't overfull, which means I should mention portion size is just right: big enough to be considered generous, but not the kind than makes you want to take a nap from discomfort (I will totally eat myself sick on Indian though when given the opportunity).

Price, yes yes, blah blah blah, totally reasonable. I think the spice wraps might be a little high in price, just considering portion size versus the other dishes and their prices, but the spice boxes are very fair.

Few grains of rice for thought:
1. Naan. Must have naan with Indian. Will pay extra for it. Is possible?
2. Oh the pain of styrofoam! Please, save the world! Go for cardboard! I am glad though, that your containers have a lid to close up and save for later or walk a little bit to the sun before enjoying.
Brilliant though. Truly a great way to enjoy Indian. I will be bringing my mum when she visits next! Tandori Tacos were simply amazing. I normally dont enjoy waiting in a 20min line while my parking meter is ticking away but with all the customers patiently waiting, I figured this is a must try. CORRECT! I spent 1 month of my life traveling India and this is as authentic as you can get with a full flavor profile. Each bite of my tacos was perfectly seasoned with a great flavor. The mint chutney added that extra spicy kick just as I had asked. Highly recommended from a hospitality professional. My wife and I stopped here after the Holiday Bazaar and it was worth the freezing cold weather! Man these guys can cook!! The guy was really friendly and helped me pick out what their best sellers are and what we would like. I went with the butter chicken and my wife went with the spice box. Both were filled with high quality meat and had complex flavoring. The boxes are great for walking and eating and the portions are perfect. I can't wait to spot this truck again for seconds! Chowed down on the butter chicken and shrimp for lunch today at the Irvington Halloween Festival. Overall it was very tasty with the right amount of spice to warm me up on this chilly day. The quantity is very less . Not worth the money ... Taste is minimally good .. Would not recommend it ... Complete disappointment :( I'd never had much Indian food before finding this truck, but I have since then. I have to say the food at Spice Box is still high on my list. I look for this truck whenever it is near my office. 

You can't go wrong with the channa, and any of their chicken options are good too. I especially like the ""TLC"" (tender lovin' channa) which is both chicken and channa together. They do hold back a bit on the heat but if you ask nicely they'll make it a little spicier.  I've yet to sample their chai as it tends to run out quickly but it smells wonderful. It's worth stopping by for lunch or dinner if you see them. Definitely some of the friendliest people out there in a truck. Spicebox definitely knocked it out of the ballpark for me.  The chicken tikka masala and channa combo was A-MAZEballs.  Both entrees were so rich and flavorful in spices (curry, garam masala, cumin, etc.), which is why I love Indian food.  It also contained the perfect level of heat for my wimpy-spice threshold, so I'll likely be limited to those dishes.  Fortunately, I don't see that being a problem since they were both so yummy and will order it again :)  

I'm bummed that I don't work in downtown because I'd be eating from here all the time...or perhaps that's a good thing.  My waistline and wallet are better off this way, right? :P  Nonetheless, please return to the Pyramids!  Spicebox has been added to my (selective) list of food trucks to stalk.","General:  The summary should be concise and informative, not a paraphrase of the reviews.

"China Dragon on Jacksonville Road, Ivyland, PA, is a fairly standard Chinese American house wokking dishes for the American palate. Their menu reflects it is from the same cooking school as every other such restaurant around the USA. The space offers a few tables for eating in, but the majority of their business appears to be takeout. They also offer sushi, Japanese and Thai platters, but I would be cautious going there if you have much appreciation for real food from those countries. 

I found that the egg foo young I ordered was actually pretty good compared to many others I have tried.  The two pancakes were flash fried in the wok steel, so that the outside was light and crisp, while the inside was soft, pliant and tasty.  The ubiquitous brown sauce was made to order, and was smooth, without lumpy flour balls. The fried rice on the other hand, was mass produced at an earlier time, and tasted it. Its texture was a bit dried out, and was dyed by the food coloring in the bouillon used to cook the rice. 

The net of it all was a three star moment. This place recently opened in a new little strip mall. I've never been inside, but it's close to my office so my coworkers order a lot. We ordered today and I ordered the chicken with broccoli and asparagus. While I got chicken and broccoli with my meal, there was not a piece of asparagus in sight, but instead peppers, water chestnuts, onions, and carrots. I can't be too mad about that because it was pretty tasty, but I wanted some damn asparagus.

The egg roll was very tasty and the fried rice was cooked perfectly. Delivery time was shorter than they'd estimated and it was all quite reasonable. Would patronize again. Been going to this place more for convenience than any other reason. The General Tso is good sometimes. This time it was good. But it's always annoying when they say 10 minutes when you call and it seems as if they start cooking when you arrive. My food has never been ready at the time they tell me when I call. Today they told me 10 minutes and I was out the door after 23 minutes. The price is good but I asked a couple times for crispy noodles and they forgot it. Shouldn't Chinese places always provide crispy noodles?  Thought they always did. Well this place doesn't. And when you ask for a bag there's like 10 noodles in the bag so I've learned to ask for 2 bags. Also my egg roll was burnt (see picture) and could use more vegetables in it. Location is the only reason I continue to gk here. This is the most unorganized, greasiest Chinese joint you could order from. The rude woman, whom I assume is the owner, because everything she says is ""my menu"" ""my place,"" could not be any less help at all. 
Their menu on the website is apparently different from the menu in real life. So that's and issue all in itself. But otherwise, here's the synopsis:
We ordered a side of pan fries noodles. She said they didn't have them anymore but would give us them anyway? I watched as my pan fried noodles were removed from the deep fryer in one solid form. Clearly not from a pan and udderly disgusting. 
The General Tsoa tofu is LITERALLY tiny little bricks of inedible wood chips. Deep fried until it's completely dried up and solidified. 
From the vegetarian menu, the mixed vegetables were in a brown sauce that tasted like chicken soup. Brown sauce is traditionally made with oyster sauce which, guess what? Isn't vegetarian. And also DANGEROUS since I have a seafood allergy. So I called to ask if there was any animal product in this brown sauce and the cray cray woman just started screaming, ""It's fine! It's fine okay? Bye"". 
Safe to say we're not coming back here. I would eat the bark off a tree before I would break in here during the zombie apocalypse in hopes of finding fortune cookies for survival. We've been here a few time and my dad comes here every Friday with his work buddies for lunch. 
Today I started with wonton soup. Which is not common for me to order. DELICIOUS! The soup wasn't overly salty and you could tell the wonton havent been sitting in the soup for hours! They were freshly made and very good.
I got moo sho pork and they have me twice as much rice pancakes as what they advertised on the menu. 
We will definitely be back. I used to order from here ALL THE TIME because my job is pretty much a hop skip and jump away. I always get a variety of the same things; shrimp and broccoli, shrimp egg foo young, shrimp fried rice and crab Rangoon. So far I've had not serious complaints besides forgetting some soy sauce or some sauce for my crab Rangoon but nothing life threatening until today.  I order my usual; shrimp fried rice, shrimp and broccoli and crab Rangoon. It took a little longer to get to me which I didn't mind because I was swamped in work and it's Friday so no biggie. When I got my food they forgot my sauce again for my crab Rangoon, when I opened my shrimp and broccoli I noticed that it smelled weird but I figured they just did something different to the sauce. I ate a piece of broccoli and instantly tasted sourness like something was spoiled in the platter. I tried the shrimp and almost threw up. I couldn't believe they served this. If I smelled the spoiledness you mean to tell me they couldn't. When I opened the shrimp fried rice the same smell is what I inhaled. I was so floored and disgusted. I could've ended up with food poisoning and to think how many other ppl today they served today with those spoiled behind SHRIMP..!! Needless to say I am NEVER eating there again..! I been ordering from there for a year and I'm completely shocked and disgusted.!.! Wouldn't recommend this place at all. You walk in and the workers are just straight rude to customers. Don't say hi, continue to speak Chinese on the phone making customer waiting forever. This so called restaurant is very dirty. They consistently give you the wrong order. The lady making the salads proceeded to pick her teeth then put her hands in the lettuce- furthest thing from sanitary Dirty. Young man who took my order never gave me my change. Watched the same young man cough and wipe his nose, then handle fish without washing his hands. He then put gloves on after he noticed I was watching like a hawk. I will never return. My family and I order from them very often, China Dragon is our go to place for Asian cuisine. They are always pleasant in person and on the phone, and the prices are by far the best around. Their delivery always comes a few minutes before they say it will and most importantly the food is YUMMY! We love their pork fried rice, egg rolls, shrimp toast, and the hot and sour soup is a must try! Tonight we tried their Pad Thai for the first time and it was to die for!! 

I honestly can't believe they don't have more reviews on here! Try them out, you won't be disappointed!! I usually do reviews only when I'm angry, but we just ordered general tsos combination platters and I have to say how good it was.  If you like your chicken crunchy and your sauce sticky sweet, they have the best, and I try every new place I see.  Can't be beat.
Spare rib appetizers were delicious as well and fried rice. The wonton soup is LOADED with wontons.  Delicious!","General:  The summary should be no more than 50 words.

"why make pizza at home when you can go to Pine Street Pizza for $7? no coupons or other corporate BS necessary. I was just reading Bill McThrill's review and wanted to toss in my two cents.  Pine Street makes the best white anchovy pizza in my book.  The more garlic the better and the crust is tasty.  I don't order there as much as I used to but I swear they see my number pop up on their caller ID and know my order right away. It's been a while since I've been to Pine Street Pizza, but oh, how I miss it so.  If you're looking for a ""real"" pizza (and whatever ""real"" pizza is, because we don't have much of it in Philly), this is not the place.  But if you're looking for a top notch ""Greek-style"" pizza (tons of cheese with a thick buttery crust), this is your heaven.  

The gyros are also tasty, and there's a fair amount of seating in the shop.  It seems to be a popular stop for cops in the area, and usually they're a testament to good food. I've also had the problem where I was told they don't do individual slices.  Which is one of the weirdest things I've heard from a pizza place.  I don't know, but they may also make you buy soda by the six pack.

That being said, I've been at Dirty Franks when people came back with pizza from this place by the slice.

So I'm confused about if they do or not sell pizza by the slice or perhaps they are selective about who they will sell pizza to by the slice or what you possibly need to do to qualify for the privilege of ordering pizza by the slice, but I don't think I'll be stopping by Pine Street Pizza to clear that up anytime soon.

They got an extra star since I've never actually tasted their pizza. Pretty average Pizza at best. And last time I was there they weren't selling pizza by the slice which is pretty horrendous by my book. It is pretty inexpensive though So it's perfect if your looking to eat on a budget. Paolo's which is one of my favorite Pizza spots is only a block away. So if you're looking for good pizza and aren't too concerned for price keep walking!

Upon Marcello's recommendation I do need to try that Chicken Caesar Salad though. yo get your act together and start selling by the slice!! where the f do you think you are?? Um, ok, if you are 10, I guess this place would suit you. I got a slice and the cheese was like a thick sheet of plastic (very processed and likely very cheap). Walk a couple blocks somewhere else. Pine Street Pizza is my local pizza joint, just a few doors away from my house.  They have your order ready (really no matter how big or small) within about ten minutes, and everything is always fresh and fantastic.

Very simple pizza shop stuff - hoagies, grinders, fried stuff and pizza.  The pizza leaves something to be desired (its a bit like Domino's or Pizza Hut) but we occasionally order it in a pinch.  

The staff is basic Philly pizza joint - not the most friendly, but never snappy or rude.  It's Philly - unless it is a Starbucks, there generally aren't too many places where you will get a genuine smile, at least in service situations. When I lived in Washington Square West, this was my go to place for pizza when I didn't want to spend a ton of money.  The pizza is ok, the strombolis are ok, the subs are ok, and the salads are pretty standard.  They have a large menu, but do not offer pizza by the slice.  They have delivery, but I only lived 2 blocks away and didn't want to be that lazy...    The pizza is Greek style - thicker crust, smaller slices.  All in all a great place if you don't want to spend a lot of money but still want good food.  They have ample seating, if you'd like to dine in! I LOVE THIS PLACE.

This was our ""go to"" place for both delivery and ""eat in"" for so many years in the 90's when we lived in Philadelphia.

I had a chance to rekindle that love this weekend. :)

I can only really elaborate on 2 items.  Cheese steaks (that's my wife's thing) and the Sausage Pizza. (that's MY thing!)

The cheese steaks are awesome.  You'll have to take my word for it on her recommendation.

Now on to the Pizza....

I read a couple the other reviews, and I agree, the crust is almost PERFECT, with it's buttery taste, with just that slight hint of sweetness.
The Pizza shell itself, is slightly thicker, (almost like a Boboli, but not ""doughy"")

Forget about eating it with a fork.  just treat it delicately when you start, and let it cool, just a bit.

At other Pizza places, I've had every type of ""sausage"" known to man.
From stuff that looks and tastes like pencil shavings, to giant sliced Vienna sausage circles.  (Yuck and double Yuck)

The stuff at Pine Street Pizza is the BEST!
Nice small round, pea-sized sausage balls, that are so flavorful, with just a hint of spice.  (not hot)   (almost like a very faint cinnamon, but not quite)
(see my photos)

Some things just grow on you from repeated use, but there is true quality, craftsmanship and consistency in their Pizza here!

I was saddened to hear that the owner, who was so familiar to me, passed away last year, but his daughter and the remainder of the staff (including their fast delivery) have kept the IDENTICAL taste and quality to what were our signature dishes.

It's so nice when some things stay the same!","General:  The summary should be written in the third person and should not exceed 100 words.

"I cannot fathom how this place could get more than 1 star - it's terrible!  Ordered online (okay, I give half a star more for that cool feature)- plain pizza and a cheesesteak hoagie - for delivery.  After  an hour after ordering, the delivery guy shows up with the food and since my card was already charged (the bill was $25 bucks?? what the...Pricy!!)- he immediately left.
A.  the cheesestake was completely wrong - it had American cheese (I requested Provoloone) and had only raw onions on it!  There was a miniscule amount of over-cooked dry beef on a half stale roll.  Umm, doesnt the hoagie part of the order mean lettunce and tomato?  Terrible cheesesteak - not even close to the real thing (and Pats and Genos are not the real thing folks)
B.  the pizza - yuk.  No doubt it was a frozen pie.  Seriously, in a saturated pizza shop area, how can you seriously think a frozen pie is acceptable?  
I did call the shop with the error in the sandwich and to their credit they offered to make another and deliver or give me credit (unapologetically however).  Since I did not want to wait another hour for a bad steak, I took the credit.  Just not sure why, as I surely wont be back any time soon! 
Maybe I need to try a stromboli like other reviewers say is good...but I cant imagine it will be tasty after the disaster pizza. Blech.
Save youreself the disappointment and get your cheesesteak from Cutillos and pizza from Palmeros. I will never patronize this restaurant again.  We went today to pick up cheesesteaks and witnessed unfair treatment of what appeared to be a man very down on his luck.  He was turned away from purchasing a 6 pack because he was wearing a jacket hanging open without a shirt. He was NOT refused service due to inebriation
  He turned quietly, embarrassed. with his head down and left without argument.

My husband felt moved to assist and purchased it for him while I stopped the gentleman in the parking lot.  When I went back, a rude associate behind the counter (not the original one who refused service due to lack of shirt) started mouthing off about him being drunk and saying she didn't understand why we were encouraging his behavior.  She, at no point was involved in the sale.

At no time did this man appear or sound drunk.  He was clear and lucid in his speech and humiliated for the way he was treated.

The girl behind the counter was ignorant and inappropriate to criticize my husband or our behavior and judgmental to jump to conclusions about something she was not involved in l.  She should mind her own business, stop being so judgmental and let adults make their own decisions.  We immediately canceled our order and went elsewhere.

My rating is not because of the associate Cheesesteaks were blech.  You're better off driving a mile down the road to Santina's if you want ones that aren't completely dry and lacking in cheese.

I'm willing to give them another chance with their other items, but there are plenty of other places that can give you a decent cheesesteak, without skimping on cheese or flavor. I'm incredibly happy that I live close to ice house! I came here for dinner with my dad one night and he's usually very particular with his wings and cheesesteaks. At the end of the meal he said that was one of the best he's ever had. This place is amazing. I have never ate at a place where I can honestly say I want to eat there every day.  This is the place!  I'm going to start with online ordering. There is times when I don't feel like ordering on the phone and the online ordering feature is great.  U can pay for your meal and add the tip at the end for delivery. I haven't  had one bad meal from this place. I usually get the 16 inch cheese steak and that thing is biggggg. Every once in a while who ever is cooking goes a little salt crazy but other then that everything is good. They also make in house there own cheese cake which is freakin great!  When you go in the service continues to be amazing. Not once did I have a bad experience either ordering or in store.  Delivery has to be the fastest I have ever seen.  Granted on the weekends sometimes it's a little bit extra. But they get it to you fast and it's still hot! The delivery people I can say have been great people to interact with, unlike a certain pizza joint I will not mention that we have received two intoxicated drivers. 
    The website is pretty well put together and informative and you don't have to go to a separate website just to look at the menu. We haven't tried there breakfast yet but I'm told it's just as epic as there lunch and dinner.
    If you decide to go into the store the place is clean and usually enough room to sit people. On the weekend sometimes it gets poppin. Other wise. This is my go to place for good food. The pricing has gotten way out of hand. RIDICULOUSLY expensive for what is offered. Honestly, the food really isn't that great and the service is sub par at best. This is not the go-to place for my family and friends anymore. Ownership needs to open their eyes and also listen to the critics - maybe go try the food at other places in and around town. If the quality was comparable to some places, the pricing might be more on the mark. But for the moment it's not even close. The food was supposed to be here by 6:30 called multiple times never got a phone call called again around 7:30 and they said the driver had delivered it never did never called, it is now quarter of eight and still no food! Highly disappointed in the service! Great breakfast!
Fast, friendly, and attentive service. Homemade donuts are outstanding, especially with the homemade jelly.
Anyone who does not give this place at least 4 stars just likes to be miserable. Ordered a pizza fries tonite and a hour n 25 min and it wasnt delivered yet....i called and spoke to a lady and she said it is on the oven and dosent know why its not there yet.. She said if its not there in 20 min to call back.....25 min it was here yet....the pizza was cold and hard...called back spoke to manager and she said she would make another. But couldnt say how long it would be..money was returned and went to amore pizza on 724 I saw all of the high reviews of the pizza and expected to be wow'ed. Needless to say, I wasn't. Pizza was mediocre and really overpriced. Our waitress was very friendly, so there was that.","General:  The summary should be concise and informative, ideally no more than two sentences.

"This is a decent service plaza on the southbound New Jersey Turnpike. The parking lot is very spacious, it was clean and free of debris when we visited on our way back to Virginia from Maine.  

There is a large food court inside with plenty of seating if your wish to dine in. On our visit around 6PM on a Friday the area was kind of messy with some dirty tables. The area was mostly empty with only a few tables occupied with diners.  We got some chicken, curly fries and a burger from Roy Rogers then some coffee to go from Starbucks. The chicken wasn't too good, I'm sure it had been sitting under the heat lamps for a good while. The burger was okay but certainly nothing special though I did appreciate the Roy's Fixin's Bar which allowed me to put exactly what I wanted (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, ketchup) on my burger. Service at Roy's was pretty lackluster with the employees seeming mostly disinterested in what they were doing. The gentleman that rang us up was fine with us but I caught him rolling his eyes at the customer ahead of us when the thoughtless patron took her food but left her tray on the counter. Coffee from Starbuck's was good though the service was not great. I stood for a full minute or so before I was acknowledged and had my order taken. I was kind of disappointed when I opened my cup to add sweetener and creamer and discovered my cup was only about 2/3rds full. 

In addition to Roy Rogers and Starbucks there is a Nathan's Famous, Auntie Anne's, Carvel Ice Cream and Cinnabon. There is also a small convenience store/ gift chop where you can pick up a New Jersey souvenir, snacks, beverages, food to go and other basic items you would expect to find in a convenience store. There are vending machines outside and a state lottery vending machine inside. Restrooms were clean and properly stocked on our visit and the number of Sunoco gas pumps outside was adequate for the traffic. Access into and out of the service plaza is easy. Solid. Roy Rogers delivers: fried chicken and fixins! Clean bathrooms and civilized people. ""know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads for traveling souls."" - Walt Whitman

ah, the Great American Road Trip! let's begin the reviews of our epic journey to the Imperial Centre (Washington DC), shall we?

heading down 95, about halfway on our journey, and in need of a quick break, we pulled in here. the ""facilities"" are fairly well-maintained.

a few food options - a fitting homage to another American icon, Roy Rogers, is here! - of the fast food variety, as is often found at these stops. and, as you should expect to find at service areas, the prices of fast food will be a bit higher than what they are elsewhere. 5 stars for ROY ROGERS!

   There is a secret entrance to this rest stop off Kresson road in Cherry Hill, if you know ya know. This is the greatest late night drunken stop of all time. My friends and I like to go(drunk), and pretend we are from out of town. We try our hardest to get the cashiers at Roy's to engage us, by saying things to each other like, "" phew that was a long drive!"", or ""how much further is Virgina?"" for example. Its quality 3am entertainment at its finest. 
     The fixins bar is THE BOMB. Grab yourself a Bacon Double and pile up pickles to the moon. Curly Fries or Straight cut fries will be your hardest decision. While you're there, grab yourself a sweet Camden County NJ T-Shirt. My Starbucks latte tasted like the espresso machine hasn't been cleaned or calibrated in forever.  The barista couldn't understand that I wanted soy milk...she couldn't even spell ""Jason"" on my fiance's cup...so, when they were calling for ""Jacsin,"" we didn't know it was his drink!  

Nathan's wasn't much better.  The fries had been under the heat lamp a long time and were dry yet somehow still almost undercooked in the center.  The cheese sauce didn't taste right and the hot dog was like rubber.  The cashier here was intellectually challenged as well, not understanding that I would accept Coke even though I'd asked for Pepsi.  

Are all the employees at this place rejects of other fast food establishments in the area?  It felt like we were in the twilight zone or Idiocracy...and I'm not usually one who hates on service industry people since I was a waitress for several years in college.  These folks made my head hurt.  

Steer clear of the bathrooms!  They were a disaster!! Would you believe this was my first time at a rest stop that had a food court? They had all of my favorites: Roy Rogers, Auntie Anne's, Cinnabon, and Starbucks. It was still early and I had already eaten breakfast so didn't purchase any food. I did get a fountain soda for my husband. I think it wasn't part of any of the shops. It was in the center of the food court. A medium fountain soda cost almost $2.50. It was probably pricier than had I gone to one of the shops. 

I did stop by the restrooms which were a bit outdated and one stall was nasty. 

A decent service area with a good selection of shops to pick up a quick snack without having to go out of your way to get off an exit when you are traveling. No vegetarian options at any of the restaurants in here other than one Cesar salad. Otherwise its a pretty standard NJ rest stop, with a slightly wonky traffic pattern getting you to and from the pumps. 
Bathrooms weren't exceptionally clean or dirty, but they get the job done.
Mostly though, I'll skip this one in the future so that my SO can actually find something to eat. Clean bathrooms.. What else do you need in a rest stop along the turnpike!?!? Monopolies don't need to provide good service to stay in business.  That's the case with this gas station.  The gas station attendant was totally indifferent. There are nothing but immature and loud kids working at the Starbucks... I expect a Starbucks experience wherever I go... I was embarrassed by the behavior... They need to be retrained","General:  

For example: ""The restaurant offers a diverse menu with a focus on fast food options, but the food quality is inconsistent across the various food courts.""

This is a review of a service plaza along the New Jersey Turnpike. The plaza offers a variety of fast food options, including Roy Rogers, Starbucks, Nathan's Famous, Auntie Anne's, Cinnabon, and a convenience store/gift shop. The plaza is well-maintained, with clean bathrooms and adequate gas pumps. However, the food quality varies widely. Roy Rogers delivers on its chicken and fixings, while Nathan's Famous falls short with dry fries and rubbery hot dogs. The plaza is pricier than other service areas, with higher prices for fast food and fountain soda. The plaza also lacks vegetarian options. Overall, the plaza is a decent option for a quick snack or fuel stop, but not the best choice for a satisfying meal.Ambience:  

The ambiance at this service plaza was largely unremarkable, with a mix of cleanliness and neglect. The decor was somewhat outdated and the atmosphere was generally noisy and chaotic, reflecting the typical hustle and bustle of a busy rest stop. The seating areas were mostly clean, but the overall ambiance was far from relaxing or inviting, making it more of a place for a quick stop rather than a comfortable rest.Food:  

Summary: The food options at this service plaza are limited, with Roy Rogers delivering decent fried chicken and fixings, while Starbucks provides a slightly pricier coffee experience. The Nathan's Famous, Auntie Anne's, and Cinnabon offerings were not up to par, with dry fries, rubbery hot dogs, and overly sweet Cinnabon treats.Service:  

Summary: The service at this restaurant was largely disappointing, with employees appearing disinterested or indifferent, slow service, and unprofessional behavior observed in some instances."
"I want to give 5 stars, but at this moment, I can't. Let me start from the beginning..

My team wanted lunch. I hopped on GrubHub and saw this *shiny new* place called Slice. Loved the menu and the rest of my co-workers did too. 

Things I did not like:
-Just over an hour to deliver. That's ridiculous!! Whether it be for 5 people ordering or just one person. You should really try to cut this time down! 
-$3 delivery fee. That makes me not want to tip! (yes, I still tip). Most places are $1.00 - $1.50

Things I like:
The food is really awesome here and that will make me order again. One co-worker was loving every single bite of his garlic bread cheesesteak (best he's had in Jersey). I tried the slice fries- great cheese sauce and beef, so tasty!! Veal parm sando got a thumbs up. I just had today the Blackened chicken salad and it was one of the best delivered salads I've had in quite a long time. Chicken was perfect and seasoned just right. Lots of veggies in this salad- cucumbers, carrots, olives, onions, green peppers, with an egg, cabbage, spinach and mixed greens. 

 Delivery guy is friendly and always has a smile. Cheeseburger and fries were good, unfortunately I can't give a 5 star. We ordered through grub hub and after waiting an hour for the delivery,  half of the order received was not as described. The ziti specifically stated tomato sauce and motz cheese, meat was extra. When we received it it had meat in it. The ziti was for a very unhappy vegetarian. Needless to say it was not eaten by the person it was specifically for.


So I've decided to give this place 5 stars. I ordered through the business itself and found the delivery to be right on time this time around. I ordered the hot wings and cheesesteak wrap. I have to say, I am probably one of the pickiest people when it comes to wings. This place by far has some of the best and biggest wings I've had in this area! The wrap was just as good!! So the vegetarian decided to give it another shot... She orders a side of the zucchini fries and a hit veggie wrap.. SCORE!! Food was hot upon arrival and delicious!! Very happy with the order!! Great pizza!  Good sauce to cheese ratio,  nice and crispy.  Gotta try the pepperoni rolls too!  Oh and the staff is super friendly! We've been ordering from Slice at least once a week for the past two years. We have been loyal customers and love to support local business. We placed a larger order yesterday (around $50). My husband asked for a side of ranch instead of bleu cheese and they told him it would be $1.50. FOR A SIDE OF RANCH!!!!! It they are that stingy why not just open the bag, take the bleu cheese and switch it out ?? He walked three doors down to the convenient store and bought a whole bottle for a just a little over that. You just lost our family's business. We will never return. Well this is based on what I ordered over the weekend.  Over the last few months we were impressed with the food from here.  However on Saturday I ordered a salad and a cheesesteak. The cheesesteak was terrible, dry, over cooked, barely any meat and a stale roll.  On Sunday we decided to order again.  The cheesesteak was once again terrible and the pizza was terrible too, the crust tasted like cardboard and there was an overload of oregano on it.   Not sure what has happened since we last ordered from here, but I guess we will not be getting food from here anymore I wish I could give ZERO STARS!!!  I'm gonna throw up!!!  We ordered pizza last night from here and I heated up a slice that was left over and when I went to take a bite I found A HAIR IN MY PIZZA!!!  It was UNDER THE CHEESE.  Ugh I'm gonna throw up!!!  We have had problems with them before but NEVER THIS BAD!!!  I am officially done ordering from this place. I posted a video so y'all can see that the hair was under the cheese cooked in the pizza and all. Really disappointing. Was honestly expecting more from Slice Pizzeria. Doesn't even even hold a candle to Vito's pizza down the street. Was expecting more because I heard good things about this place. It wasn't real genuine Italian cuisine like Vito's pizza is. It doesn't have the Italian aura that pizza places should have. Food is greasy and not palatable. The inside decor is trying to be modern but doesn't pull it off. It was really off putting. In conclusion the place isn't really worth going too. Might as well go to Vito's pizza. My boyfriend and I ordered dinner and I could not be more impressed. It was delivered in under 40 minutes which is pretty good for delivery in this area. I ordered the blackened chicken salad and it is the best salad I've gotten delivered from any pizza shop in south jersey. The chicken was flavorful (not too spicy at all), cooked perfectly, and everything was fresh. He ordered the garlic cheesesteak and is super satisfied with everything. The bread was perfectly toasted, which is so hard to get when you order delivery. We will definitely place Slice at the #1 spot on our order out list. I want to try everything on the menu! Fresh, tasty, and exceptional. Best garlic knots, pasta, pizza and curly fries I've had in a long time. I live in south Jersey near Ocean City (basically the land of Italian food) but haven't had something this flavorful and memorable in a while! This place is about 40 min away from me and I still make sure to swing by and come back. Great Pizza, BUT ... on my first attempt to bring a pizza back to the hotel during my stay in the area, my Apple driving directions placed the pizzeria's location at the intersection of Hurtsville and Clements Bridge Roads near the McDonalds.  For the next 60 minutes, I called Slice Pizzeria 4 times asking for help with directions.  After 75 minutes, I called the restaurant a fifth time and let them know I wouldn't make it.  This was the first time in my life that I ordered ""take out"" and not able to pick it up.  During my last visit to the area, I downloaded a different driving directions program (Waze) and was able to locate the pizzeria.  So I went in, ordered food, took it back to my hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Tonight I called in only to find out my phone number has been black-balled from placing orders by phone by the owner.  Complete BS considering I was in contact with the restaurant when I originally couldn't locate it and they were no help with directions.  Not sure I'll go back ...","General: The Slice Pizzeria offers a diverse menu with various options, including vegetarian and gluten-free selections, and is praised for its quality food, friendly staff, and efficient delivery service.

"I've popped into Bimini on two occasions now and I'm a fan. I've tried a couple of their smoothies, which are solid. I like some of the combos at other smoothie shops a bit more, but I think with some tinkering around I can probably find a smoothie that hits the spot for me. 

On my last visit I ordered a chicken caesar wrap to go. The wrap was substantial, not overly dressed, and came with a bag of chips. 

Staff has always been very friendly. Great option for something healthy and fast to-go! Love this place!! Philadelphia does not have enough convenient, affordable options for healthy fare. Bimini has delicious wraps starting at $5, salads starting at $7 and even filling 20oz smoothies for $6! I typically rely on Honeygrow or Sweetgreen for a fresh healthy option, and leave there spending $13 on a trendy salad. This is a welcome change.

I got the small Waldorf wrap (yes they have 2 sizes!!) filled with feta, apples, walnuts and balsamic. I decided to add chicken for $2 more but probably didn't need it, it was plenty loaded! I also got a large strawberry banana smoothie (it was my first time so I went all out!) and it was so yummy and fresh.

The interior is cute with reclaimed wood and there is seating at the bar along the wall in case you want to stay.

I'll be back Bimini! What a cute little shop! This place just opened up on 2nd St in Northern Liberties. It's very health hipster themed with little cacti and weird gold shapes on the natural wood bar - so I love it!

I opted to get a smoothie - the Blueberry Avocado Kale smoothie to be exact. The smoothies are made with greek yogurt but they also have a diary free option as well. My smoothie was sweetened with Honey (vegans look out). It took a few minutes for them to make the smoothie but they have all fresh ingredients. The smoothie was pretty tasty and I felt pretty healthy drinking it. They have a bunch of really great sounding flavors that I would love to try. You also have the option for add ins - like protein. I might have to stop and try it because this place is on the way home from my gym. 

For two smoothies, it was about $10 which is what I would expect for a boutique smoothie/juice bar. I definitely will be back. this is my go to smoothie place in the neighborhood. sweet greens is my go to, love this place. I come here pretty often since I live in the area. The staff is friendly. The service is a little slow, but the juices are freshly made so it's expected. 

The reason I'm giving this place one star is because the oatmeal is marketed as a healthy option.  You get to choose 3 toppings and any of this can be a sweetener.  What they don't tell you is that there's already tons of sugar mixed into the oatmeal before they make it. I've mentioned how misleading this is and how it's even dangerous for customers who may be diabetic, but I've been ignored every time. 

Maybe at first read it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but people go to juice bars because they care about what they are putting into their bodies.  When I ordered the oatmeal I asked 2 times if there was sugar in it. And then specifically stated that I wanted it unsweetened and sugar free.  I only realized there was sugar in the oatmeal once I took the first bite. That's when the staff told me that there was sugar mixed into the oatmeal before they make it.  What other items are on the menu and marketed as healthy food options, but then pre-made with sugar? I don't know how many stars to give this place. For food, it's about a 4 or 5. Very good. FOR SERVICE it's got to be below a 1. I work for a small business in the area. If I treated my customers like they do, we'd be shut down in a week. It's very strange. You walk in and they look at you like you're an annoyance. The delivery and tone of every person I've spoken to there has been one of irritation. I totally don't get it. I don't expect much and NEVER write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so here. It's not me, because I've observed them treat others like this. The people who work there are rude, plain and simple.  There is an icy vibe from the minute you walk in the door, and it continues even AFTER I've greeted them with a smile, a tip, and order something very simple. I wonder who else has experienced this here? One time I was snapped at for not seeing where the spoons were. Me questioning this  really put the young lady behind the counter over the edge. It's weird that it's the woman at the front AND the people who make your food who seem constantly annoyed! It makes for an unpleasant vibe. I swear every time I come back to this place, I keep my distance for awhile b/c I always feel crappy upon leaving. The only reason I keep coming back is b/c it's truly a yummy lunch spot, but I have a feeling I'm about done dealing with this place. Great healthy spot in Fishtown! Bimini has a large menu full of delicious salads, wraps, smoothies, and fresh pressed juice. All of the selections were very affordable. I ordered the Thai chicken wrap and a Dream Vacation juice. Both choices tasted delicious but know that the ""regular"" size wrap is actually quite small. I will definitely be back to try more goodies on their menu!! This place is so fresh and hearty. Everything in the menu is all about health and healthy lifestyle! I really enjoy coming here after the gym or on a nice Sunday morning. The quality of everything is very good and fresh. So glad to have a place like this in the neighborhood This place looked so promising with all its fun healthy flavors, but unfortunately looks can be deceiving. I ordered the blueberry kale avocado smoothie, it took close to 10 minutes to make, which I'm fine waiting if it was a great smoothie. When I tasted the smoothie it tasted like ice and unripe avocado. For 6 bucks that's just not okay. I appreciate the effort using fresh fruit and veggies but I think they need to train their employees some more. Wow... This juice bar is one of the best in the city.  The atmosphere and decor were welcoming and the employees were more than helpful. There many different options to choose from but the one girl behind the counter gave me a good idea what ingredients went well together.  They also had some free samples of some of their smoothies and free fruit infused water which was nice. They convinced me to try the Immortal Detox and it was one of the best (healthiest) juices I had. I'll definitely be back again to try one of their salads or smoothies because from what I can see their stuff is pretty fresh.","General:

"While the food is certainly not the best Mexican, it's not the worst.  Very nice decor, certainly done well for a little town such as Nolensville.   Salsa is mediocre, and the chips are decent when they aren't over heated/burned.  Last night's experience:  my fajita beef taco salad was very tasty....until we looked back towards the bar area and noticed two servers BRUSHING THEIR TEETH with toothbrushes behind the bar.  They knew we were watching them, but that didn't stop their brushing.  We finally called over our server and told her to tell those two to go to the bathroom if they want to brush their teeth... Needless to say, we lost our appetite.  Our server (a middle aged woman) was very apologetic, and even gave us a discount card for our next meal.  She claimed it was because the servers were ""YOUNG"".   Really? 
Sorry, but if this is what goes on at this restaurant, I'll definitely be going elsewhere.  Such a shame, because I kinda liked this place. I wouldn't suggest any Nashvillians jump in their cars and head South of the border to Nolensville but if you are in town I highly suggest Campo Azul.  They just moved to a new location so it's fresh and clean.  They have a cool little bar area, excellent service, and consistant Mexican dishes. Campo Azul is a sweet little hot spot in this quaint town and an excellent addition to the area; possibly the best restaurant within the Nolensville city limits.

I lived in Nolensville from middle through high school and saw the town go from ""Wheres-ville?"" to a conveniently accessed town with its own city hall.  Many restaurants have come and gone--pizzerias, american fare, Asian, barbecue--and I have undoubtedly tried them all.  Replacing what was once Rio Verde (the mediocre Mexican restaurant of Nolensville in a different location) is Campo Azul... a restaurant so good that I'm sure that the residents of the city have long forgotten the former similarity.

Sporting a clean, festive atmosphere; offering an extended simple menu beyond your normal  two pages of everything familiar; quick and efficient service; cheap drink deals (including $4 Margaronas); Campo Azul could likely be Nolesnville's dining star as no other restaurant is currently executing all of the above qualities here.

Of all the meals I have had, I have thoroughly enjoyed each one.  Although they don't create the best salsa I've ever had (still nice and chunky but a bit heavy on the cilantro for my personal liking), I'm confident you'll enjoy this sweet little spot as much as my family and I do! Swing a dead cat and you're bound to hit an ""authentic Mexican restaurant"" around Nashville. I've tried them all (almost) and Campo Azul (or ""Camp Blue"" to us Gringos) is hands down my favorite. They have a super friendly staff, quick service and it never takes long to get a table and your food -- even when they're busy.  The manager often says ""see you tomorrow"" after we pay and head towards the door. And while I know he's joking I often think ""yeah, tomorrow sounds good!""

You can grab a margarita for around 5 bucks and their salsa is on point. 

Muy bien! One of my best experiences at a Mexican restaurant.  Where I live has about 4 Mexican restaurants in the area but I would without hesitation drive the 20 min drive over to Nolensville just to eat at Campo Azul.  I think everything from the food to drink specials is priced incredibly well. We got Jim's nachos and the portion was huge and the food was hot and really good.  All Mexican restaurants have the same menu pretty much, so you can get what they have at Campo Azul anywhere else but the difference is the prices, the portions, the flavor and the service.  The waitstaff was very friendly, always checked on us, one man (possibly a manager) came up patted us on the back, made us laugh and asked us if we needed anything.  At one point I was outside when it got too chilly as the sun went down, so I grabbed my drink and our basket of chips to head inside, as I approached the door a man with his hands completely full of a bucket piled w dishes rushed right over to use his foot to open the door for me.  I thought that was nice of him considering most places I would've been ignored and left to open the door myself.  On top of everything else I've said I loved the bright colors of the restaurant and the decor they used .  The place feels really clean and really inviting and I felt appreciated as a customer there.  So yes I would return in a heartbeat. The salsa is great. The cheese dip is better than any other place around (yes, there is a difference). The staff......eh. They weren't rude or anything. They just seemed a bit snappy. Anyway, everything else was pretty much the same as most Mexican restaurants fit to serve American customers. I do not understand any bad reviews for this place!?  Party of 12 tonight, excellent service from the time we walked in the door until we lingered out. The food is fabulous, plentiful and a heck of deal. 
First time to leave a review on Yelp!
Now know you can't let anyone's bad experience hinder your decision to go there. LOVED IT! Horrible service.. food was very bland. The flour tortillas they use are from the store. The waitress we had didn't even know the menu well. We waited for ever to have our order taken. I'm Mexican and this place is down right bad. If you want GOOD AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Do yourself a favor... drive by this place wave bye to it as you do so. And head over to nolensville were you can get authentic Mexican food with flavor! Ex. Las fogatas, las Amricas, la Hacienda, tacos Lpez or Mxico Tennessee taqueria. People continue to rate this terribly. This pisses me. I have been going here frequently for a year and a half and it seems they get better every time. Seated behind two joints that are considered some of the best in town, you'd think they'd get zero business. Instead, I drive up on a peaceful Saturday afternoon and there's no parking. When you get in you are greeted by friendly staff. It seems like all the tables are full. Salsa is exceptional and drinks are good as well. I ordered an burrito and it was very flavorful. I would consider the service a year ago to be less than adequate, but it has definitely improved. The atmosphere is also enjoyable and authentic. If you are in town I would highly recommend you try here if you're not in the mood for Martin's or Outlander's. Strengths:
Good menu. Bar with TV in back. Outdoor seating 
Opportunities:
Parking can be an issue. Service at times just rude. They don't seem to enjoy their work or appreciate their customers.

"Out of all the Pizza Plus locations I've been to, I think this is the best one. The food is always hot and fresh whether it be done in, takeout, or delivery. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food is always ready on time or even before it's projected. 

The actual brick and mortar location is always kept very clean and the tables are set up for maximum occupant but without feeling too cramped.

I recommend the BBQ chicken pizza and of course, and order of steak fries with ranch. Definitely one of my favorite go to pizza chains for a quick and easy pizza feast. There are some pretty good deals here. The pizza is average. Not the best in town, but far from the worst. The wings are pretty decent too.
There are tables of every size so they can accommodate parties. 

Service 7/10
Food     7/10
Deals    8/10
Atmosphere is fun. If you want a cheap and delicious lunch option then hit up Pizza plus. A friend and i went in for the lunch buffet once and it has become a tradition. The staff will always ask what kind of pizza you want them to make,they dont stick to the standard pepperoni or Hawaiian (Hawaiian pizza is the worst thing ever). The freshest wings and chicken fingers and the salad bar is never wilted. The pizza though! The juiciest meats and softest dough yet still crunchy! Got the #7 today w/ my aunt and uncle, it's a 3 topping pizza, wings, tenders, steak fries, deep fried mushrooms and zucchini for just over $30. 

It's SUPA BOM! The place was very busy and our food came out very quickly. The pizza was perfectly cooked, and we ordered it well done. The toppings were okay, I like it topped a bit more. 

The tenders are awesome here, they are a light thin batter, so the chicken really stands out. The ranch dressing is on point too. Overall, Pizza Plus is a solid local spot that delivers a good value. I am very disappointed in my latest experience with Pizza Plus. We ordered a tomato and mushroom pizza for pickup. Arrive to get the pizza and it's mushrooms and garlic. The snot nose at the register offers no apology, no effort to correct the mistake, no offer of a discount. Just a shrug and a ""that'll be $25."" The place is being operated by punk kids who have clearly not been told that customer service involves more than screwing up orders and taking peoples money...the owner should be embarrassed.
The funniest part of the whole thing is that the girl who took the order went to the trouble of asking whether we wanted fresh or cooked tomatoes.
I understand mistakes happen but the whole ""tough shit"" attitude is totally not appreciated. I will take my business elsewhere. Had a bit of a problem with a delivery order. Pizza Plus made it right! They turned a potential issue into a great customer service opportunity! 
The food is always delivered hot and delicious. They give accurate delivery times. I inadvertently ordered during a big football game...they let me know it was going to take a while. I ordered from a competitor and was told 45 minutes..the pizza came an hour late and cold. I prefer accuracy to pie in the sky promises that lead to frustration. The pizza plus website is great and there are good deals for combo meals. 
All in all...pizza plus is better than other similar places. :-) My friends, family and I used to love Pizza Plus. It's conveniently located for us and the pizza, wings and fries were delicious.

However, a large group of us ordered pizza the night before we were all participating in a fun run. There were probably about 10 of us who ate the pizza (just pepperoni) and all of us got sick to varying degrees. My husband and I got it the worst. I had to leave the run the next morning to go home and spent the rest of the day in the bathroom. Many of my friends made it through the run but were sick after. 

I understand that these things happen, but we did think we should call Pizza Plus to let them know that 10 of us got sick after eating their pizza. We spoke to the manager who was extremely rude and condescending. She said that we didn't have food poisoning (because of the timing of everything) and told us that she would look up the definition for us.

Really? I don't care what you call it, but 10 of us got sick. You should probably check what you served last night.

She finally barely eked out an, ""I'm sorry that happened to you,"" at the end of the phone call.

Gee, thanks. We have not been back since. Usually don't have issues with pizza plus but this time definitely did. Ordered a large size wing which the online website says is about 24 wings I was also told it would ready in 20 minuets. I got there exactly 20 minuets later and was told it was going to be a little bit longer which was just fine. 1 whole hour later one of the managers asked me what my order name was and then went to the back and brought out my order instantly... I got to my car and decided to look at my food and it was all cold like it was sitting out for and hour... and they only gave me 12 wings... pretty disappointed with pizza plus. It's never a bad time to get pizza and wings at Pizza Plus. Great overall service at this location and they do their best to make sure that you're taken care of. Be warned that they do have limited parking and slow service if you go when there's during a prime time game. The limited parking is due to the Bully's next door and the mass amount of orders will delay your order. We waited at least 30-45 mins for our order to come to our table because of how busy they were at the time. So if you're looking for something quick I would suggest calling to place an order in advance. Pizza Plus is one of those places, you have an experience from 2 to 5 stars, but all my Pizza Buffet experiences recently has been consistently 4 to 5 stars and having Pizza Buffet back is why hand's down 5 stars, you get Chicken Tender pieces, two saucy flavors (personally I like plain and dip myself), Super Bom Steak Fries, Bom Ass Pizza with lots of real cheese and toppings (many varieties - up to 3) and lastly the Fresh and Tasty Salad bar with the Best Ranch and Blue Cheese in town, and a deluxe salad bar, it's only around $10 without a sugary drink, they even have glass bottle Sprite/Cokes! You can also get a buffet punch card, buy 10 get 1 free, that's a  star experience, M-F!","General:  Here's the review summary:

"We LOVE Roberto's! They have the best pizza (crispy thin crust with lots of toppings), salads (loaded with cheese), buffalo chicken strips, fried chicken, cheese burgers, garlic cheese bread, I could go on & on. We even take a friend with us regularly that is a cheeseburger and fry kind of guy, he loves it too. It is a nice friendly atmosphere, with lots of regulars, a friendly staff & great cooks. I highly recommend especially if you are a thin crust pizza lover. Oh one more thing, they have crushed ice! Hello, does it get better than that? Most chain restaurants kill taste buds at high prices, with ho hum food, and ""I wish you hadn't have come in and interrupted my leaning on the counter time"" service, this place is the opposite. Roberto's is a wonderful old-school place. The food is so good. One of the best thin crust pizzas in St Louis. Pasta, steaks, burgers, and chicken (that isn't even breaded until you order it). A friendly staff that makes you feel like a regular on the first visit. A great place to meet with the extended family, there is something on the menu for everyone and no one will be disappointed. I grew up in Florissant so Roberto's has an enduring place in my heart and my stomach. For the record, Flo MO was a great place to grow up. I had a happy childhood and do not need therapy. (at least not today LOL )

I'm sure that I am dating myself but I can vividly recall the days when Mullanphy Garden shopping center was a player. There was a Del Monte supermarket, a Ben Franklin five and dime and a wonderful bakery that my family visited most Sundays after church- if it was in the budget and if all of us kids had been good that week. While I am sad that those retail stalwarts no longer reside here, I am eternally grateful that Roberto's has withstood the test of time.

OK, first we must all agree that we are not talking about authentic Roma or Napoli pie here...let's just get that out of the way up front. Yes, there is a distinctly non-Italian yellowish cheese on the pie. True that bacon is not a traditional pizza topping. These facts are noted for full disclosure but are completely irrelevant IMHO. 

I know that Roberto's has a proper menu but I have experienced very little of it. It is ALL about the bacon pizza bro! GLORIOUS. When I am back in my home town visiting Mom and Dad Roberto's is a must. When I am not back in Flo I have random dreams about the delicious, kooky, non-authentic bacon pizza pie. I could eat this every single day of my life- it is pizza crack for chrissakes !
 
Maybe it is a good thing I don't live in Florissant any more... Alright, this is hard. 

Food was 5 stars. The pizza in particular was terrific. All of the other dishes ordered by our group of 8 came exactly correct and exactly fine tasting. Our server was a very aware of our needs and did a great job keeping things straight. The owner came by and did all those nice things.

Now the hard part:
This place has zero, and I mean zero atmosphere. My garage is more conducive to dining out than this place. I know the goal is Food-Service-Fair Pricing. This is achieved. But dang, dress the place up a tad otherwise this will be a carry out and catering only type of place. So, being in NoCo, did a quick search for pasta in the area and this place popped up with 4.5 stars and I thought, ok, let's do it. No, shouldn't have. Outdated decor aside, something just felt amiss in here. I couldn't quite get comfortable. Then, the Pizza. 12"" thin w/sausage, bacon, onion and bell pepper.  It had an unsavory pungent flavor to it. First, I thought it was the sauce.. then I thought, it might be the unnecessary shaved Parmesean that they melted on top. Then, I thought, it doesn't matter, I don't like it. By far the best pizza in St. Louis. Great value for the amount of food you receive As the other review stated, this pizza is LEGIT.  Absolutely fantastic!  Our Pizza had a delightful fresh crispy thin crust and was lightly sauced (the way my wife likes it).  The italian sausage was a flavorful link sausage which had been it into slices.  The cheese tasted like some sort of blend, predominantly provel; we loved it.  This is St Louis Style Pizza at its best.  

Our lasagna, on the other hand, was forgettable. It was a bit loose and there wasn't much ricotta or other yumminess. It was mostly meat sauce and noodles, with a slice of provel on top. 

I also had the dinner salad with the garlic vinaigrette. The salad was topped with a generous portion of provel and the dressing was great. I recommend it. 

The atmosphere here is strictly low rent - padded metal chairs, Formica tables, and the original tile floor from the 60's, with a half dozen tiny 19 inch TVs on the wall. The staff was very friendly and we got the impression (by eavesdropping) that this place attracts a lot of regulars. Despite the fact that we weren't regulars, we were treated very well. Excellent Pizza, Great Food, Resonable Prices. A family style restaurant with good service! I have eaten here multiple times before I decided to review this joint and I'm giving it 5 stars for multiple reasons. I go with my significant others family, who have been coming here for over 40 years. Having people come to a location for so long is a sign that this place has withstood the times and must have a lot going for it! While the restaurant itself could use a few upgrades, I actually have become fond of the homey and familiar feel I get when I arrive to one of my favorite pizza joints. 

Some people who previously reviewed Robertos must not be familiar with St. Louis style pizza. I remember my first time eating St. Louis style pizza (over 20 years ago) I thought that they got something wrong and their style of pizza was horrific. NOW, I wouldn't have my pizza any other way!! There is no deep dish and no hand tossed. You get your good ole thin crust pizza. My favorite pizza is the shrimp pizza. Don't be fooled, I was very reserved my first time, I wasn't sure that mini shrimp on a pizza would be good. Holy smokes, I crave this pizza all the time and we drive over 30 mins out of our way to enjoy it. I highly recommend it (don't forget to ask for extra shrimp). They also have your classic pizzas, we enjoy the Garbage pizza too (their name for supreme pizza). 
We always start with toasted ravioli and garlic cheese bread. Two things you can't go wrong with either! 

The atmosphere is very casual, they have TVs around with your favorite games on and you should grab a bucket of beer while you watch. Their buckets are a great price, unlike most places I go to these days that charge an insane amount for your basic bucket! 

Staff is always kind, friendly and smiling. Yes they are always busy, but it takes some patience for a great pizza and we never wait to be seated, even though every time we go, it's a full house! Janice is the owner and usually serves us as well. Talk about an amazing woman! She is so kind and makes each time we visit, a great experience. 

I would say, don't knock it until you try it. We don't live anywhere near it and make sure to eat there at least once a month. It would be great to chow on some pizza while you watch the Blues or Cards play! It's the epitome of traditional St. Louis, now go grab some pizza and cold brews! Worst pizza I've ever had. Service was extremely slow. Kraft singles as the cheese? I will make pizza at home before eating here ever again.","General:  The summary should be at most 20 words long.

"This bakery reminds me of those old style, no frills , local French bakeries in Paris from 20 years ago. 
The shop is a bit dingy looking and the selection is very limited but they do have some decent offerings at reasonable prices. . We purchased a ham and cheese croissant, choux puffs, and a ganache. I asked my family to pick out a few things but they had to think long and hard to pick something that looked really appealing. Usually they are macaroon fans but they said these macaroons looked different and funny. The macaroons are puffed up and spongier looking. Cute little french bakery down an alley, an you can sit in a little patio overlooking the water. They have a lot of dessert options and coffee. The decision was so hard to make, but I finally settled on the berry mousse cake. It was so sweet, fluffy, buttery, berry and soft. Not for those who don't like frosting! It was like a little cake with a ton of butter cream, which I love, but may not be for everyone. Also, the almond cookies were so good and buttery. Great place to top of your visit to New Hope. All desserts were $2-$4. I wanted to love this little bakery by the river in middle of New Hope, but unfortunately the items I tried here were disappointing. On the plus side, service was very friendly - everyone I interacted with was genuinely nice, and they were offering some samples outside the bakery. The location by the river is also lovely, and there is a nice outside seating area. They also accept credit cards now.

I tried the mango mousse and the clafoutis, which were $5.50 each. The mousse was ok, very light and not too sweet, but the sponge beneath was more like a grainy wet cookie. The custard portion of the clafoutis was ok - very eggy and barely sweet - but I didn't like the tough crust underneath or the very bright and artificial cherries. I hope these two are exceptions and that the rest of the large selection is better, but I don't think I'll be stopping by again the next time I'm in the area. We came here by recommendation of quite a few friends. It is a bakery/pastry shop with bread, baguettes, muffins, quiches, croissants (regular, almond, ham & cheese), eclairs, coffee, hot chocolate, cappuccino, etc. 

I had an almond croissant which was really flaky and tasty. I also had a cappuccino. 

It is hard to find if you don't know where it is. You have to take a little alley street between a few shops to get to C'est La Vie. The parking lot only has about 3-4 spots and the pastry shop has a metal wire Eiffel Tower in front of it.

I'm not really a breakfast type of person, but I'd go back the next time I'm in or passing through New Hope.

They have a few small tables indoors. Don't remember if any outdoors. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon after brunch to get something sweet to take home. If your looking for this place just look for the sign and take a left down the Lane as their sign says. 

I figured what better to try at a French bakery then croissants. I selected an almond and a chocolate. 

The almond was my favorite of the two. Loved the almond paste filling just the right amount of sweetness and it was crispy on the outside and topped with sliced almond and dusted with powdered sugar... Delicious! 


They have some outdoor seating so you can sit and have a coffee and enjoy your treat but it was a bit too cold outside to take advantage of that. 

It's a cute little shop to visit when you're in the area. 

Cash Only... After diner we walked to get desert. I remember passing this place and thought..ooooh la-la. a french bakery, can't wait to try. We arrive inside and boy was it steaming hot in there. I thought great. ovens been on all day, fresh made deserts, this has to be good. I got a cream cheese mousse cake and a grand marnier chocolate mousse cake. We took a couple bites and the texture was thick and gummy. nothing smooth about it. W e were highly disappointed. I was going to complain but thought had another thought. that was $10 well spent to know not to ever go back. They have the best quiche and croissant ham and cheese sandwiches! Don't overlook them just because if the gorgeous dessert case. Take some bread home with you. Drink a fancy coffee outside in their covered area by the river. Folks who work there are lovely. There's no parking, but more than likely you'll only find this place on foot anyway. This cute little bakery is tucked away at the back of an alley, but has a nice outdoor seating area with a view of the river. The baked goods are OK, but nothing amazing. The coffee is drinkable. I would come back for a pastry by the river, but not so much for the actual goods. Wonderful little French bakery within sight of the New Hope-Lambertville Bridge; with a cup of coffee and a croissant, you couldn't ask for a better start to your day.
Run by a French baker, his wife and their German shepherd romping in the parking lot, on occasion. One of the few things in New Hope that has not completely turned into a tourist trap. We got several items for Christmas here a Yule log cake chocolate with hazelnut everyone thought was fabulous and an apple tartan and Christmas cookies for the kids oh and a dozen croissants half chocolate and half almond and one cinnamon pastry. Everything was so fresh and tasty. 
Recently I picked up plain croissants for work and all my coworkers commented on how light and buttery they were and asked where to get them. 
Just yesterday my husband and I got a lemon pastry DELICIOUS and a pistachio horn also very yummy. 
We live two blocks away and love this little gem.","General:  The summary should be no longer than 15 words.

"This is the 3rd time this has happened. I order a ""SUPER"" chicken bowl and I get the amount of chicken that is in a regular chicken bowl. I know this to be true because I have been alternating between the ""SUPER"" chicken bowl and the regular chicken bowl the past 5 visits and this is the last time I waste my money at Hana Kitchen.

I recommend to never get their ""SUPER"" sized option for meat bowls because it's just a rip you off. It's a blatant lie that the ""SUPER"" option is advertised as twice the meat. You're better off ordering 2 mini bowls. The very first time I went here was my first year of college at UCSB. I remember that time being super delicious and flavorful. However, every time I go there now, I am very disappointed by the lack of flavor in the chicken and vegetables. 

It is a great price though, especially for the portion sizes! You have to get the creamy Sriracha mayo and teriyaki sauce on the side! That is what gives the food the flavor, plus it's just super tasty.  

I personally recommend getting the mini size. The container looks small, but trust me it's more than enough! The only difference between the mini and the small is that the small has more meat! If you love waiting 90 minutes for a cold, messed up order, this is the place for you!

Basically, horrible delivery service. We ordered online but sbmenus wasn't letting us add boba to our drinks so we called and asked them to add boba which they ok'd AND even left a note on the order to remind them but there was no boba. We also ordered two half chicken half beef bowls but we got one chicken and one beef. I called after we got the food. They would only give us free drinks the next time we visit. We'll see if they remember. I just want my money back. Update! Nobody on here has written about the vegan boba Hana Kitchen offers, so I'm here to enlighten you. Hana Kitchen offers vegan boba! Done. 

Just kidding, here are the details: if you order a fruit-flavored black tea, it automatically comes without milk. Then you can add options ranging from boba to lychee or mango jelly. I had a lychee black tea with lychee jelly and boba and it hit the spot on one of the first really warm days of spring. It cane to $5.15 total. 

I've heard that the boba balls can be hit-or-miss, so I must have been there on a good day. They were perfectly chewy, cooked through, and deliciously soaking in the lychee tea. Other tea flavors include raspberry and honeydew. 

The location's big, wide open front kept me feeling pandemic-safe, and staff were wearing masks and gloves. Plus there was a container of hand sanitizer in the pick-up area. I was there early in the day so it was pretty much empty. My only wish? Disposable instead of plastic boba straws! Horrible service/delivery and employee knowledge.  

When this place first opened the bowls were better quality and larger portions. Ever since, they have lessened in quality and gotten smaller.

I want go to Hana Kitchen because I like the style of food and it is so convenient.  However, I have been treated poorly by employees and the owner on multiple occasions for asking simple menu and delivery questions.  The employees have no idea how to treat a customer or how to give compensation when due. 

They once took over 90 minutes to deliver, forgot one of my bobas and all the sauce I requested. When I called to tell them, they said they are too busy to bring me the rest of my order and that they would give me 10% off my next boba.  ""Thanks so much for that 0.40 off""

DONT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR BUSINESS Two Words: Got Tums?

I have probably been here at least 15 times. I usually either get the chicken or vegan bowl. It's always a hit and miss with their quality of food/service.

I ordered the mini vegan bowl, they had a soy protein meat. I've had soy meats before when I was vegan, but this was kinda funky tasting and cold in the middle. My bowl seemed to have been dressed with oil because there was a one inch layer of oil at the bottom. 

Their milk teas are a hit and miss. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's too sweet. My friend actually poured water in his tea because it was too sweet. But hey, more bang for yo' buck, right?

Holy hell, I have never had such bad stomach cramps from eating at a restaurant before. It's been a few hours and my stomach is still kickin'! I was so excited when I found out a legitimate boba place came to IV so I checked it out right away. This review will only be for the ice milk boba I had, I'll edit later when I try out the food. 
The boba was pretty good and I really liked the ice milk, reminds me of half n half but not as sweet which I liked. The tapioca wasn't as sweet as I hoped, probably not honey boba like halfnhalfs, but the texture of the tapioca was perfect! Some of my friends had a problem with the tapioca freezing while it sat in their slush but it is what it is. They tried the peach and lychee and really liked those as well. Overall, it was pretty darn good boba for IV standards and even back home (LA) standards. I will definitely be coming here often for my boba fix. I think people are overly harsh with their critics. I've been to this place twice for boba and both times I received excellent service.  The manager asked me both times how my drink was.  They just opened last week and I think they're still trying to perfect their food and drinks but I'm just so happy that there's FINALLY a decent boba place in IV. Compared to Naan Stop and the Pho place, this boba tastes like heaven.  I prefer the slushies to the ice milk.  Can't wait for them to get more milk teas though.

Still need to try the food but overall I'm just happy for some Asian culture in IV. The place started out nice, but service has diminished over time.  Workers have gotten lazier and boba has gotten worse.  They run out of ingredients frequently and are very inconsistent with the quality of the food.   My cashier had trouble working the cash register.  Most of the time, the workers are sitting and eating in the indoor tables.  
My drink usually comes out too sweet even after ordering half syrup.  Many times I ask for it to be changed but they just throw half the drink out and dilute it with water.  By then, it's just nasty and I'm not drinking boba anymore.  Very lazy work.  I'm done with this place, I gave it way too many chances. Dear Hana Kitchen, 
Today is the the day you have disappointed me the most. I still like you, sort of. Your food is palatable, but incredibly inconsistent.  Never have I ever received such a small portion of meat from you. Why?? It's so cheap to make a mini bowl of chicken, rice, and vegetables. You must be making a killing off of selling it for $4.5. Why? Why?!?

All things aside, I've gone from loving the homeliness of Asian style chicken, rice, and veg to absolutely refusing to ever go back to HK for a meal. I'll come back for the boba I guess. Their milk tea is awful and overly sweet, but my favorite drink from them is the strawberry pineapple snow. But still, I'm really miffed about this.","General:

"My husband is a cyclist and bike engineer so this seemed like a natural pit stop for coffee en route to the Katy Trail for a morning of riding. Oh, and we love coffee ;) I have to admit that it was the Lucky Charm latte pics on Yelp that drew me in but fair warning, that's a seasonal offering. 

The shop is part coffee shop and part bike repair and parts store (as the name hints). The menu is tight with a few seasonal latte options along with classics like cappuccinos and drip coffee. I couldn't tell if they use a local roaster or rotate their bean offerings. They do offer oat milk and a handful of homemade baked goods (I don't recall where they come from but they looked delicious). 

We ended up ordering a breve latte and honey lavender latte. The honey lavender latte was delicious and not overly sweet. Had we not been taking it to go, I would have ordered the lovely shakerato - it looked beautiful and perfect for sipping with a book in hand. 

The only reason I didn't give it four stars was the service was kind of meh - not the fun/friendly coffee shop/barista vibe that rounds out the overall coffee shop experience. Stumbled upon this place looking for another place and it was a pleasant surprise. The workers where fun and cheery which was a good juxtaposition from you mood because I had a shit ton of work to do and they were a good light hearted start to my work (so thanks guys). I had a very good mocha latte (I don't like the taste of coffee Unless it tastes like chocolate milk). So I enjoyed a very good mocha latte and worked. I love the bike/ coffee shop vibe and I'll have to bring my bike there next time needs a tune up. Nice little gem of a coffee shop on Morganford. 

They sell high end coffee and are also a bike shop. They have a handful of local pastries available for breakfast, as well, but don't come super hungry. Typically they have some donuts, scones, and muffins to offer. 

The most recent time I went, I got a bottomless coffee and really appreciated that they came around to fill my mug continuously. That was more than I was expecting. They staff is really friendly. 

I really like the space too, nice tables, nice light and airy vibes. They sell bikes and high end cycling gear, too.

Besides Hartford, this neighborhood is kind of a coffee dessert so it was really nice to have these guys in the area. Road Crew Coffee is such a cool concept! Part coffee shop. Part bike shop. While I personally know nothing about cycles, I do know that they serve up some really bold brews! 

I have been to their Tower Grove location several times when I've been in the area. It's a tad off the beaten path, but they are definitely worth the journey. While they don't roast their own beans, they do offer many local options for you to brew at home. 

What drew me in for this visit was their St. Patrick's Day special latte, the Lucky Charms latte. The milk used to create this incredible concoction was soaked in... you guessed it, Lucky Charms cereal! Typically I drink my coffee black, but to indulge during a holiday, I skipped over the rainbow and was rewarded with a cup full of gold. The sweetness of the cereal milk was so unique. It actually tasted like my favorite cereal! Love that Road Crew made an effort to try something out of the box for St. Patrick's Day. 

The inside of this cafe is super clean and stylish. You don't feel like you're sitting in a bike repair shop, and there wasn't that weird new tire rubber smell. They have a pretty large seating area in the cafe too. Would love to spend a day working remotely from their space. I came here several times for a cappuccino and it was very good. The service was quick. The store is a coffee shop and bicycle store. It is a bit hard to tell from the outside what this store is selling. There was indoor and outdoor seating although indoor seems closed off for now. There is online ordering available. They also offer pastries from a place called Whisk. The few times I came though the pastries seem to be delivered late. I was able to try a couple doughnuts and thought the chocolate one was best. I am not sure if this was due to covid but the cashier asked me what tip I wanted to leave and then added it. I am happy to tip when I want but would prefer to enter myself or select no vs have to answer to the employee for my choices. So glad to have this little coffee shop right downstairs from us. My husband and I went in for their soft opening on 10/20/19, I ordered a cold brew and he got a vanilla latte. Both were delicious and the people who work there were all quite friendly! I foresee myself spending a good deal of time here and I can't wait to try more of their items. Loved my experience at Road Crew! The guys working were extremely friendly and wanted to tell us all about the company. Loved the coffee selection and the fact that they serve Blueprint! They also told us they will have rotating options each month from other local roasters. On top of all this, they have hours that make it possible for those of us that work to still go grab a coffee after work. It's a great spot in an up and coming neighborhood. Every single drink I've ever gotten here has been incredible. Some of the best coffee I've ever had in St. Louis. From the coffee to the tea to some of the more special creations, nothing has ever disappointed. The baristas are always excited to tell you about what's on the menu and make recommendations. Also, try out their delicious oat milk with one of your espresso drinks! It's completely different from any nondairy milk you'd get from the grocery store. 

Barista told us that they get their pastries from Whisk, and they have a very good selection of delicious gluten-free/vegan options there.  

The interior is also delightful. Tends to be quiet -- sometimes around breakfast/weekends it will pick up, but even then it's still a very pleasant noise level. And since they have a decent layout of tables and bar-height seating, it definitely makes for a good place to study. 

If you're ever in the neighborhood or just looking for some seriously great coffee in St. Louis, give Road Crew a try! I came here at my friend's recommendation. The inside is quite nice, especially the tables. Each table has a little plant on it. The staff is super friendly and the service is quick. I had a latte - simple but delicious.

Highly recommended if you're looking for a place to work/study while having a cup of high-quality coffee. New coffee shop in Tower Grove that doubles as a bike repair shop. 

The place has a very open feel to it, as there are tons of windows, however there is not a lot of seating. There are a couple tables and a couple high top seats by the window. 

They offer coffee and a few espresso drinks from Blueprint, a couple pastries from Whisk, and a couple donuts from Donut Drive-In. 

I got a vanilla latte and a pastry and they were delicious","General:

"After a full day of walking around town, drinking beer and enjoying the best of Philly we needed to recharge our batteries with shots of espresso. 

We ordered two doubles and drank them just as fast as they made them. The coffee was good and just the jolt we needed to get ready for an awesome night out. I had a dentist appointment at Jeferson hospital the other day and I stopped for a bite to eat at Au Bon Pan.
I ordered a turkey and swiss with bacon on a croissant with cajun mayo and a cup of soup and hot coffee. The sandwich was better than the average because of the flaky, buttery croissant. I also have a cup of chicken tortilla soup that was a little too tame for my taste, but I spice it up some. The coffee was just okay, but overall a good lunch.
What I really like about this place is that in the evening, they mark down all the baked goods to half a price. That means I can get my fave lemon pound cake and cookies and eat twice as much...... more for me! We were stuck at Jefferson for 4 hours and needed a place to go to have a cappucino and kill some time.  Friendly staff - decently clean bathrooms, good coffee (I had an iced coffee, Mom had a capp.)

Not great but not awful. I ate here once and tried one thing, so take this review for what its worth.

I just want to write a quick review and say this is not a place for big appetite.  I paid $7 for one of the skimpiest sandwiches I ever had.  I left hungry and had to go across the street to Taco Bell.

I wouldn't mind paying extra $ for great taste but this place didnt really wow me.  Probably not even the best sandwich I had in past week.

This place seems to bank on high volume customers due to location rather than winning people over. I stopped in around 7pm to grab a wrap using my birthday free sandwich coupon. I asked the woman if the coupon is good for wraps and she chuckles (with an attitude) and says ""i guess"". Alrighty. I ordered the Napa Chicken with Avocado wrap as it seemed like one of the healthier options. I asked if I have options of wraps like whole grain or something. Again, she chuckled and said no, like I'm some sort of peasant. SORRY. 

The girl who was making my wrap seemed a little more friendly, I guess. I didn't try it until about 2 hours later but it wasn't soggy or anything. They go a little heavy on the vinaigrette, I'd recommend asking for it light. The wrap definitely tasted fresh and not too unhealthy. In cold days you always look for something to eat to warm you up like a good soup or a chili. Yesterday, I stopped at this location to see what they have to offer in the soups menu. They had Vegetarian Chili which caught my appetite. WOW, BIG mistake! The pinto and light kidney beans were hard which indicated me that the beans were raw, it was NOT cooked. The chili also has NO flavor, It was not well seasoned, and the taste was not good. I wasted my money. Therefore, if you are a vegetarian, and you're looking to have a good veggie chili, please DO NOT buy their Vegetarian Chili. I will not buy that Vegetarian Chili again. 

Spanish:

En los das fros uno siempre busca algo de comer caliente para calentarse el cuerpo, como una buena sopa o un chili. Ayer, me detuve en este lugar para ver lo que tienen que ofrecer en el men de sopas. Tenan chili vegetariano que despert mi apetito. WOW, gran error que comet! Los frijoles (habichuelas) pintos, o habichuelas de rin estaba duras, lo que me indic que las habichuelas (frijoles) NO estaban cocinadas. El chili tampoco tena buen sabor, no estaba bien sazonado. Perd mi dinero. Por lo tanto, si usted es vegetariano, y usted est mirando para tener un buen chili vegetariano, por favor NO compre el Chili vegetariano de ellos. Definitivamente no comprare este Chili Vegetariano de nuevo. So dirty! Flies everywhere! I'm not picky at all when it comes to food, hence why I eat out, but this place was beyond filthy. I truly looked at the people eating there wonder are you all blind. Rude staff! Stopped in for a sandwich while visiting at Jeff. The woman who took the order was fine. I ordered a tomato caprese sandwich. Waited 15 minutes while others got served from behind me, after ordering. The girl called out turkey chipotle three times in vain. When I finally asked about mine, she regarded me with great disdain and said, I called you three times! Where were you? And shoved it at me with disgust. I had to give it back and ask for a to-go bag because they never bothered to ask. I told her I'd been standing right there the whole time. The three of them joined forces to imply I was a fool. Well- I know the difference between 'tomato caprese' and 'turkey chipotle' for sure. Management should teach some customer service skills. I don't mind mistakes, but don't act like its the fault of the customer. The sandwich was boring and tasteless anyway. Plenty of better options all around. Waited 8 minutes behind two other customers, trying to buy a cookie. The cashier obviously had no training or experience.  I finally gave up when it was obvious it might be another 8 before I could purchase.  Train your staff or have more on duty. As we walked around we did a drop in for some tea. The hot water was really really HOT but they had a good selection. They also had their soups labeled Vegetarian and Gluten Free - point for them! 

The staff was really nice and helpful and their pastries looked delicious and the prices were pretty good. Overall for a coffee/tea and pastry fix this is a good place to go.","General:  The summary should be no more than 100 words.

"Great little corner bar. Family friendly, our granddaughters seven and ten love to go here with us. Varied menu, great adult and kid choices. Happy hour Saturday and Sunday 3 to 5:30. Great place to stop relax and take a breather while sipping something cold. The granddaughters love the Mesa corn and request to go here just to get some. They make in house potato chips which are always a winner. I found the chips to be a bit over salted but tasty. We also tried the wings, margarita flatbread and pesto chicken flatbread, all delicious,. Wings nice and crispy, done just like we like them. Service friendly and welcoming, always with a smile. This is a great little lunch spot. The flatbread is really well done and tasty. We also had a butter lettuce salad that was great. We did not really love the chips as they were very heavy in the salt and not so fresh. They have an impressive selection of tap beers with lots of IPA options and even had a $2 cooler with beers and drinks.There is plenty of indoor seating and being on the corner two sides of outdoor patio seating. With lots of space, this place would be fun anytime but seemed ideal for the Covid distance dining. The service was excellent, prompt and friendly. I would highly recommend stopping here for a bite or drink!
Also, we stopped in for lunch on Mother's Day and they comped Mom's lunch. What a pleasant surprise! We live a few blocks away on the Mesa so we were excited to have a new spot to walk to. Sat at the bar, service was friendly and the food and drinks were great! We tried the carne asada flatbread, wings and jalapeo poppers. The food was excellent! Hot and fresh ingredients. They lose a half a star because the acoustics in the main dining area need work, it is SO loud we couldn't really hear each other even sitting right next to each other at the bar. Overall it was great and we will make it a regular spot! (also please put a few more kid friendly options on the menu) Awesome place on one of the Mesa's best corners. 

Looking to people-watch? Corner Tap has you covered. Their expansive corner patio looks out to a super busy intersection full of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians alike. It's truly intriguing to see how many of them will go by in the course of only a few minutes. Free entertainment at its best. 

I enjoy the overall relaxed vibe of this spot. I came here for the first time last summer and it appeared to have been doing well with Covid in place. The menu was QR-style which was convenient.

Corner Tap has a great variety of beers on tap and I was intrigued over the unique options. They also have a good selection of eats. I've tried their cauliflower appetizer and their Mesa Corn dish - both were exceptional. Great light bites that complement the drinks well. Service was also stellar with our waitress checking on us often. 

This place is just what the Mesa has needed. I hope they do well. I still haven't been inside to sit down and eat and drink at this establishment, so I can't speak at all to the atmosphere. My 22-year old son and his friends seem to enjoy meeting here for drinks and dinner before they start their night.

I have, however, had the opportunity to eat take-out from here, when I've asked my son to swing by and bring us dinner on his way. He recommended the chicken wings, so I ordered for my husband and I to split the dry wings, the sliders, the prosciutto flatbread, and the butter lettuce salad with cashews and pears.

Let's start with the flatbread. It was ghastly, but that could have been because we got it take-out. It was soggy and generally awful. I might try it again inside the restaurant, but I'll never order it take-out again.

The sliders were very good, somewhat soggy (take-out), and massive. I couldn't believe how an order of sliders was plenty for the 2 of us!

The dry wings were fantastic. Of the things I've described up to now, they were the best and we've reordered them for takeout twice more. How do they get such big wings??? The only thing is I can't figure out how many you're supposed to get. Once we got 8. Once we got 6. Once we got 7. Is it by weight or are you supposed to get some prescribed number? I want it to be 6 or 8, so I don't have to arm wrestle my husband over the odd one.

Finally, the butter salad. OMG! A revelation. I wish that salad would never stop. It's a perfect balance of fat, acid, and heat. What an incredibly robust salad on top of gorgeous fragile salad leaves. We've also ordered this salad with every subsequent order (and we always will), because it's just that damn good.

Can't speak to the beers or ambience of the joint, but the wings and butter lettuce salad demand 4 stars! Great spot on the mesa! Stopped in last night for some quick bites and was not disappointed. Hubby and I shared the butter leaf salad (so good), wings (I liked the dry rub more than the buffalo, but both were great) jalapeo poppers (it comes with 4, but I devoured one before I took the pic) and a carne asada pizza (great concept and great tasting). All of it was delicious. Service was great, place was clean, hand sanitizers were readily available and they had heating lamps to accommodate the breeze from outdoor dining. Can't ask for anything more, especially in such trying times for restaurants. New favorite neighborhood spot! Staff is very diligent and safe, I felt very comfortable dining outdoors here. The food is excellent! We love the margherita flat bread, dry rub wings and the red leaf salad. Been living in Santa Barbara for 8 years and gone to every restaurant in town a number of times. Corner tap has the best wings in the area, hands down. Crispy on the outside, hot on the inside, always meaty and juicy. Recommend Buffalo wings with a side of bbq sauce. Flatbreads are solid as well, but the wings steal the show.

This place also has a great location, ambience, and solid beer selection. There's always space, even at typical peak times, but it's never empty as to be awkward. This place rocks. Good location on the Mesa. Ambiance was nice outside. Service was great. The meat lovers flatbread was amazing, but I wasn't a big fan of the prosciutto flatbread.  The kids pasta was decent but it tasted very spicy for some reason. The mojito was decent, too. Will probably come back at some point! Great spot to enjoy good food and people watch. Flat breads are very good, the wings and jalapeno poppers are excellent and the staff is amazing. Eryn is my favorite. If you like the vibe in the Mesa you'll love this locally owned restaurant.","General:  Corner Tap is a popular, locally-owned restaurant on the Mesa, known for its extensive menu of beer options, diverse food offerings, and great service.

"This was one of my favorite fast food spots before the pandemic. I lived in this neighborhood for a few years and although I moved a good 20 minutes away, I still travel to this location instead of going to one closer. That's all good the food is. The crab rangoons are my favorites of anywhere I've eaten them. Service is still as fast as ever and the quality of food hasn't changed a bit. Typical Chinese fast food.  Not too pricey, and the dumplings and stir fry are good.  Wonton soup is sometimes ok, sometimes way too salty.

They have tables and chairs, but nobody actually uses them except to wait for their take-out.  Most of the time I go for delivery, which is good and generally arrives on time. I DON'T CARE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE FORTUNE COOKIES, I LOVE YOU THE MOST.

Super cheap, delivery, and I always have equal-sized leftovers for the next day if I just get a pint of soup and the dumplings. If you crave spice, they can give you spicy- we recommend the spicy garlic wontons, extra spicy, for the daring.

Imma try your vegetarian real soon, Spring. I've only ordered take out/delivery from Spring Chinese Restaurant twice, but from what I can tell it's a pretty solid spot. 

The first time, I ordered the shrimp fried rice and chicken wings and the Kung Po Triple Crown. The shrimp fried rice and wings were amazing! I legit could not get enough of it even as I was eating it. Even thinking about it now, I just might order it again today. I asked for it to be spicy because I really like spicy food. It wasn't as spicy as I wanted (I have a ridiculous spice tolerance so it was probably okay for most people) so I added some of my own pepper myself. The Kung Po Triple Crown was okay. Also had to make adjustment to it with my pepper and I wish there was a lot more protein in it. I definitely enjoyed the shrimp fried rice more, hence why I stuck to that the second time I ordered from them. 

The portion sizes are also incredibly generous. With those two meals, I was able to eat lunch and dinner for like 2-3 days. Probably would have lasted even longer if I hadn't overstuffed myself the first day with the shrimp fried rice and wings. 

For the price and the portion size (and delicious food), I'll definitely be ordering from them again. This take out Chinese restaurant is same with all the other Chinese take out restaurants.  I always order the Seafood Soup and Two Shrimp Egg Rolls.  I didn't like their dumpings cuz the skin is too thick and not my style.  I haven't tried their General Tso's or Sesame but I am sure that those dishes must be good cuz those dishes are the staple of American Chinese take out restaurants.  Cheap prices.  Why not?  Oh yeah, they don't accept card.  Wack. Please do not order from this place. Not only is it a crappy little place on Lancaster ave but in the last few months they do everything they can to make you order more food in order to use your card.. Also they no longer give you menus but when you ask for one they charge you for it. 
They are totally outta control. Don't come to this place, they put cash tax in their own packet not to the government and they gave people some else's food to others because the food is trash. I had ordered few times in this place the worst Chinese food I ever eat, general tso chicken not even spicy too sweet, the fried rice is disgusting, the broccoli with beef taste not authentic. We pay, we eat, we should get the food we deserve. There are so many take out restaurants nearby. Not just this one with bad food bad service and bad attitude. Ugh. This is not a place where you can just pick something that sounds good off the menu without knowing exactly what it is. Avoid the Szechuan-style noodles at all costs. But it sounds like it could be good, right? Well apparently it's a terrible lo mein with more onions and cabbage than noodles in a gross goopy brown sauce. There wasn't much noodle going on, let alone anything even remotely Szechuan. I'm by no means a picky eater, and I found them completely inedible. I never ever throw away food, so this must not constitute as food. 

Even the fries were bad. Who messes up French fries? Spring Chinese Restaurant does. They were hard, dry, and stale tasting. Really? You could buy frozen fries at the grocery store and they'd come out much better than these. At least these were still edible though. 

The hot and sour soup was decent. Not necessarily good, but passable. The pork fried rice was bland, but also passable. The half a fried chicken was also okay. Delivery took over 20 minutes longer than they said it would, making it a whole hour and twenty minute wait for this miserable meal. They should be ashamed at how bad their food is, even for American takeout Chinese, for which the bar is set pretty low in the first place. I'm giving them two stars only because the food didn't make me horrendously ill (so far), and it would be (mostly) edible in case of a nuclear holocaust. In fact, the good news is that it might even survive a nuclear holocaust.

Evergreen, I'll never stray from you again. Hell, this place even makes China Inn look tasty. We were craving Chinese food with easy parking, so went to Spring. They do have their COVID system down pat - they use a door pass-through box for both payment and passing the food. We ordered the crab rangoons, orange beef, and sweet & sour chicken. I really wanted the sweet and sour pork, but they ran out of pork. 

To start - the rangoons, while cheap at 10 for $5 were not the slightest bit crisp. The dough was thick and chewy, so that combined with having to do take out, it wasn't the best. The sauce they come with is very good though.

The sweet and sour chicken with fried rice was very greasy - and the pieces of chicken were small within the fried batter. 

The orange beef was pretty good, but a bit of an odd texture. Meh. The best way to describe this place. Not amazing, not terrible. Just meh.

The food is your typical greasy and cholesterol/heart-attack inducing Chinese food available around the corner of the block. That isn't to say it is bad - it's just the Americanized (and nothing compared to the real stuff) Chinese food.

The vegetarian options are plenty, although vegetarians should be wary of anything fried - the fryers are the same whether they are frying chicken, pork, beef, or your vegetables.

The upside is that the food is quite cheap, and for a location close to several college campuses, I'm sure they're doing quite well. 

Just watch your back when you're in the area; streets in the high 30's through low 40's in the Lancaster/Powelton Area can get a bit seedy in the evenings and night.","General:  The summary should be written in the third person.

"Country skillet is a hidden gem in Clearwater/Largo. It's a pretty nice sized diner that has a very broad menu and the best prices. I tend to go here when I'm craving something heavy or comfort food. They also offer lightning fast takeout so that's an option if you're not looking to dine in.

I would recommend getting their breakfast sandwich if you're craving breakfast. The sandwich is big and I believe it's less than $5. They have the best thick-cut bacon in town and you can request it on your sandwich as well as a variety of cheeses or fried/scrambled eggs.

For lunch, nothing hits the spot more than the open face sandwiches. They have turkey with a light gravy and a roast beef with a dark gravy. It's also served with mashed potatoes. You may feel 5 pounds heavier after eating it but it's so worth it. As you have heard me say many times I LOVE breakfast anytime of the day.  So I'm down in Clearwater visiting family. My father suggested we go to a local favorite, The Country Skillet. It's a modest diner with an extremely friendly staff. We were seated right away   Our server promptly took our order. What I ordered? 2 eggs over, it came w 2 sausage links (very tasty), 2 strips of bacon (very tasty), shredded hash browns (very hot and tasty). I hope you can see why I gave them 5 stars. The portions were huge and freshly cooked to order. Will definitely be my go to diner when I come back!! Well done Country Skillet!!! Country Skillet is a great Southern Diner!  If you are in the area and want a nice hearty breakfast, this is your spot.  My boyfriend and I were greeted in the casual environment and ordered some sweet tea.  After scanning the menu (see attached pic), i decided on the Corn Beef Hash breakfast (my Irish side can not resist).  There were so many choices to have with this breakfast.  I decided on scrambled eggs, hash browns and a buttermilk biscuit. MMMMmmmm good. This place is not by any means fine dining but definitely a good bang for your buck! I'll start with the negatives. The decor is outdated and could use some improvement. The staff is not the friendliest. And the coffee is not strong, it might be to some people but to me it was weak. I'm very picky with my coffee and only like strong coffee. Hence why only given 4 Stars. The food however is delicious and the prices are affordable! 

I only come here for breakfast for one reason: POTATO PANCAKES! Yummm. This is the only place around me that I know I can get them without going to a German restaurant, and they are my favorite! They have a combo that's 3 potato pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of breakfast meat, I get bacon (4 strips), all for $8.99. My mother and I split this meal and we were both full. 2 ppl for $9! Can't beat that. 

My husband ordered some meal that was like 3 meals in one: biscuits and gravy, sausage, eggs, potatoes, and 2 big pancakes all for the same price of $8.99. Ridiculous! Even more ridiculous, he ate it all! 

So although not the prettiest place to eat at lol, I always come here when I get a craving for potato pancakes! And if you're a family on a budget this is a great place to come. Especially since two people can share a meal unless you want lots of leftovers! Huge portions for little money. Back to what you know. After the abysmal breakfast yesterday, and being called out on Twitter by the place (yes they have a Twitter feed AND they respond), we decided to go back to the tried and true Country Skillet. 

Food here is always top notch as is the service. I will confess, my wife and I do know the owner, but I say in the same breath, he treats everyone the same, with a smile (as only a Greek diner owner can)

Today, in preparation for our dinner plans at Bern's we decided to split. The ultimate combo ($8.99) is a ton of food, meaning shareable all day long. Eggs, pancakes, toast, sausage (which we subbed for turkey sausage and that was excellent) 1/2 order of biscuit and gravy (which they subbed bacon for us) potatoes and toast. 

An absolutely picture perfect breakfast in a place that you should make a regular stop. We haven't stopped by for years and thought we should give it another try.  Saturday lunchtime is very busy.  We were about the only table that wasn't ordering breakfast foods.  

We were in the mood for club sandwiches.  I ordered the Turkey Club and my partner ordered the Black Forest Ham and Cheese Club(see pics).  They were just what we were looking for.  We didn't want anything fancy...just a good 'ole club sammy.  

It has a friendly staff and an owner that doesn't mind filling a water glass(or two).  We will return.  As a side note, nearly every table around us got an order of French Toast.  Maybe we should try some next time. Such a great home-style, southern restaurant. We go here for breakfast at least once a month! I have yet to be disappointed with anything on the menu. Excellent breakfast.Great prices.Amazing hash browns  and they give you a whole lot.Sirloin steak and 3 eggs with hash browns and toast. $8.99 great price.The country boy omelette is amazing too.Great place. I just ordered the Cajun Special omelette (egg whites only) with hash browns from here. I had NO expectations, as it was the only place via UberEats that would deliver breakfast. WOW! I am very impressed. My omelette is perfect, delicious and interesting. The hash browns exceeded any expectation. I would definitely order from here again! All the employees made my friend and I feel very welcome. Food was very good, it came out fast and hot. The portions were large and very affordable. Definitely an old fashion family restaurant that gives IHOP and Perkins a run for their money.","General:  The summary should be written in the third person and should be no longer than two sentences.

"Good basic local tavern.  Clean with nice staff.  I dropped by when some kind of pop music bingo was going on .  Everyone was having a good mellow time.  The crowd were all adults who acted like adults .  I will be back. It is a nice place to have a drink with no pretense. I dropped by The Tailgate last Friday night, looking forward to ""making a night out of it"" watching the Notre Dame, IU games and enjoying the Karaoke.

I have visited The Tailgate on several previous occasions, enjoying the quality food,  drink specials and overall atmosphere.
But last Friday night was not one of those times.

The wait staff was apparently overwhelmed by the size or number of customers as it took 20 minutes to request the two items (onions and cheese) that were left off the Traditional Tailgator burger that was ordered. 
And another 25 minutes to ( for the second time) get  the correct slice of cheese.
At this point, the burger and fries were cold, the bun was stale.
I left the food uneaten.
I requested and paid the check, essentially paying $10 for a diet coke with a refill.
Extremely disappointed.
Took the rest of my night's business to BW3's.

I believe there were three possible resolutions that were available to the wait staff, the worst of which (from a customer's viewpoint) was taken.

I'm not inclined to reward sub par service or quality.

Just thought you might wanna know. Went on a Saturday night and only about 7 tables total. Waitress seemed very overwhelmed and when help arrived the service was just as slow. Took 45 mins or so to get our food which was decent but nothing worth going back for. Nice bar! Very friendly staff! The kitchen was closed but they made an exception for us ladies and made sure we enjoyed what we ordered. Very sweet! Friday night karaoke regulars were entertaining and very good! I'll be back again! Most everything is scratch made. I had the fish and chips and it was definitely breaded to order and not frozen. My wife had the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken was grilled and extremely juicy and flavorful. Very good for bar food and I will for sure be back. Not friendly to Door Dash employees! They must not want the business. I walked in on a Thursday around noon to pick up an order (with only 2 people in the whole place) and as soon as I walked in with my bag, the lady behind the counter in the kitchen shouted ""we don't have any orders so it's not going to be ready"" when I showed them my phone that the order was placed and asked what to do she got crappy and said ""it's not ready and it's never going to be ready!"" I was very surprised she was so rude! I just had to contact the customer and tell them to cancel it because they weren't going to make the food! Maybe the system was down that communicates between them and Door Dash? But that is NO way to treat customers and decline business. I'll be shocked if they stay open. Two stars instead of one because our waitress was very nice and, while my meal was not great, my family enjoyed their food. I ordered the pulled pork, which came out (45 minutes later) as cold, mushy and sour. I was simply not going to eat it, however my father in-law, who was paying for our meals, nicely asked the waitress if I could have a different selection or just have the item removed from the bill. I didn't want to make the rest of my family wait while another meal was prepared so the waitress kindly offered to take the sandwich off the bill. Everything was fine until the owner showed up demanding to know what was wrong with the sandwich, then rudely said ""Well that's our pulled pork, next time don't order it."" He then stormed off to the kitchen without allowing me the chance to respond. 

This was very embarrassing and upsetting for me and immediately ruined the experience for my family, Not only will I not be ordering the pulled pork again ( why would order something again when it was so bad the first time?) we will not be returning again period. Oddly enough, when my father in-law clarified that it was he who the owner should have a problem with and not myself, the owner no-longer seemed to have an issue.... Good price on drinks but the two for $2 tacos were horrid.   We wanted to have tacos for Tuesday but this is NOT the place.    They were cheap shells with a meat like substance and you can go to Mikes for quarter tacos that are better.  We actually went to Taco Bell after we didn't eat their tacos (let that sink in for a minute ... if taco bell is an improvement ?? Just saying! ) The server got our drink order wrong and ""forgot we wanted food"".   I doubt we'll be back.  I gave  2 stars because I'm just a nice guy.. i'm not the type of person who really enjoys hanging out in bars, but that said, i love hanging out at the tailgate! such a welcoming atmosphere with friendly staff. perfect place to catch a game & drink like you're back in college (a lot for a cheap price). After reading the reviews, my wife and I had to give this local sports bar a try.  We were disappointed.  The only reason it got any stars at all was the food.  The appetizer basket which had fried pickles, pretzel stick, cheese curds, and onion rings was good.  Fried to perfection and it tasted as if it came straight from the fryer.  We both ordered burgers, our server didn't ask for a temp on them which was odd, I'm guessing it's because they stuff the burger.  My wife got a cheese burger (wasn't stuffed) and I got the jalapeo and pepper jack (fresh jalapeos inside). You could taste the charcoal grill flavor.  It was good and the price was reasonable for what you got. Took awhile to get the food out to tables though.

What made me give two stars was the atmosphere.  The bar seems to be the owner and his friends drinking pub.  There was a large group outside on the patio (right next to a yogurt shop).  They were cursing and yelling, we almost turned around a left before we walked in.  When we walked in the door, we stood there awkwardly wondering if it was self seat or waiting.  After about 30 sec a lady came over and told us to sit wherever.  After we ordered drinks, the water and a bud light bottle, showed up about 10min later.  We were 2 of 10 customers in the joint.  

The group from outside came to the bar and was loud and actually wrestling.  I understand that the bar can't control the customers but they kept giving them drinks.  They in no way tried to quiet them down, sober them up, or even give a hell about anyone else in the restaurant.

In all might be a good lunch joint for a burger and a beer, but get in and get out before the drunks start showing up.","General:  The Tailgate Sports Bar and Grill is a local establishment that offers a variety of food options, including quality burgers and appetizers, with a welcoming atmosphere.

"Glossy menus and lots of items with ""Slam"" in the name, but I just went with the loaded veggie omelet which had the lowest calorie count on the menu especially with a bowl of fruit instead of hash browns and an English Muffin, dry.

I was close enough to the kitchen to hear my waitress send the muffin back when she specifically wrote ""dry"" on the ticket. No worries, the food was still hot and fresh when it arrived.

Coffee needed two creamers and a sugar to cut the bitterness.

Good service! This Denny's was close to where I was visiting and I came in for my FREE birthday month Grand Slam Breakfast. Just sign up for Denny's Rewards at their website and you'll be emailed.

The dining room was set up for social distancing, it was warm and at 7:30AM on a Sunday morning, there were two other parties of two, one waitress, one cook, one dishwasher and a manager...service was slow and the cook kept pulling his mask down while preparing the food. If I didn't already recover from Covid-19 and test double negative, I would've left. Considering my meal was free, I adjusted to the atmosphere.

The bonus to all of this is that my meal was delivered to me hot and fresh! Overall, I would probably would not come back. Forgot my lunch for work so we ordered lunch to go at Denny's.  I ordered the Bourbon BBQ burger & was so hungry by the time we picked it up that I forgot to take a picture.  It was very yummy looking & I wasn't even thinking about you guys as I ate it.  It is served on a cheddar bun & it was DELICIOUS & just as described on the menu.  The fries were a little cold, but I can't hold that against them, as we all know better then to order fries to go.  I would have liked to have a few more of them however.  Overall, our order was correct as ordered & I had a nice size burger for my belly.  We have ordered from there before & they will probably be one of our regular lunch places in the future. Been here a few times. Usually is ok. But today I waited 1 HOUR! For a burger. Wow. 
The waitress did t even came over to refill drinks. All I could here was employees arguing in the back. 
Anyway. I guess this would be the last time for me here. Ohhh yeah. And if you do come. Being a jacket. It is freezing in here. Always is ... I decided to have breakfast at Dennys this morning. The server came over to me and seated me and introduced herself and told me she would be my server. She smiled at me while introducing herself. Her name is Amanda and she is a very pleasant. individual. Service with a smile! I had a T-bone steak and it was prepared just the way I like it along with egg whites and wheat pancakes. The food was very good. Karen waited 20 min to get our drinks . Then didn't come back for our orders . So after 30 min I was polite and said thank you Karen but we're going to just leave. There was only one other table in there . She was literally sitting down running her mouth on her phone . 
So she said we had to pay for our drinks , but I refused because she took forever to come back and get our orders . She continued to say she was the only waitress and we had to compensate for her being there alone . I knew she used the wrong word ""compensate"" so I corrected her and she continued to get mad and call me a bitch and told me to get the fuck out . I was very polite . I'll never return . She should be fired ! I see the cooks back there working their butts off and waitresses standing yelling to them but no one in the actual restaurant is getting served. they're so focused on the outside orders like uber eats. come on man... Typical Denny's. I wasn't expecting a 5 star experience here obviously but I do appreciate when an establishment can at least play some music to create somewhat of an ambience but they literally had no music playing. No vibes lol. My friends and I literally had to play our music, luckily we had a speaker with us so we created our own experience. 

Our waitress was efficient and made sure we had waters full. The food was alright. I ordered the fit breakfast skillet. I was a little bland and I had to add a lot of pepper and hot sauce for flavor but it was healthy and pretty good after that. 


I know it's just Denny's but my advice is add some uplifting music so your diners can have a better experience. Quick shout out to the Denny's manager. We stopped in after the concert last night, like many others. After being ignored by our server the hostess got our drinks. The server later takes our order and I get a milkshake, to which she says, oh I don't know if I can do that. Then Our friend joins us and asks for a menu. Server replies, ""Wow, it's going to be a while"" ""For a menu?"" ""No, before I can get your food order"" 
So then she comes back to take his order. No update on the milkshake status as she ""still hasn't had an opportunity to check."" 
She brings him his drink, goes to take another order, and then returns to ask him he's decided what he wanted. ""You already took my order"" ""Oh yeah that's right"" walks away... 2 minutes later ""what was your order again?"" He repeats the order while suggesting she write it down, since she forgot the first time. He justifiably asks for the manager, and explains all of this. He came in clutch with the milkshakes, extra French toast, and covered the bill for us. 
We understand that not everything is in a servers control, but poor customer service is never ok. 
The kitchen threw down though. The French toast, on point, not eggy, the burger was juicy, and it was all out pretty quickly. Arrived about 12:20 Sunday. About five parties where waiting even though as many tables where available in various stages of readiness..... After 20 min we got seated and the another 20 min we could order.... When the food arrived only two of the three entree arrived. They might have gotten cold waiting for the other but the AC was out and it was to hot for the food to get cold...","General:  Here's the review summary:
